Whew ! a nineteen-inch drill .	it's working ! oh , Doctor -- you play beautifully .
I'm getting tired .	why don't we all turn in ? it's been a long day .
you can't expect to iron out all the kinks in one night .	I think the doctor is a genius ! don't you , Igor ?
the doctor said to allow seven minutes : no more and no less -- or else they could both become hopelessly paralyzed .	how long is it so far ?
four	three minutes to go !
yes .	what d'ya want to do to kill time ?
Igor -- are you sure the monster has a good brain ? are you absolutely certain that you took the brain of Hans Delbruck that night ?	absolutely ! may my mother grow two heads if I'm not telling the truth .

extremely well .	how nice .
did you have a pleasant trip ?	yes , thank you . it wasn't bad .

sometimes I'm afraid of the lightning .	just an atmospheric discharge . nothing to be afraid of .
are you busy ?	that's quite all right . what is it , dear ?
could I lie down in your bed for a little while ? I just can't sleep .	we only arrived a few minutes ago .
well ...	oh please -- just till I get sleepy . then you can force me right back to my room .

Inga !	yes , you may ... but don't make any noise .
what is it ? is something wrong , Doctor ?	listen ! don't you hear that strange music ?
yes ! what could it be at this hour ?	I don't know . it just woke me up .
Dr. Fronkonsteen -- look !	whatever it is , it's coming from down there . I'm going down to see .
let me come with you , Doctor , please ! I don't want to stay up here alone .	all right then , quietly ! close your robe and stay right behind me . don't make a sound !
Ooh !	what a filthy mess .
look , Doctor !	well , this explains the music .
&apos; as the minuteness of the parts formed a great hindrance to my speed , I resolved to make the creature of a gigantic stature .' of course ! that would simplify everything .	and look at this , Doctor !
soon , all the electrical secrets of Heaven shall be mine .	oh , Frederick ... you're not only a great doctor , you're a great ... you're almost a ...
a god ?	yes !
right here ?	raise the platform , hurry !

good night , Doctor .	good night !
why , doctor ... how wonderful for you .	wonderful ? it's terrible ! terrible , terrible , terrible , terrible , terrible !
what's wrong , Doctor ? you seem ... lonely .	oh , a little . but it's not just physical loneliness . it's the pangs that come from missing someone intellectually ... as I have you .
I've missed you intellectually , too , Doctor .	it's terrible -- the price society demands in the name of fidelity ... ultimately ?
not fooling around .	I know , but I mean -- not fooling around physically ? ... Or not fooling around intellectually ?
I see what you mean .	there can never ... ever ... be anything physical between us . you know that , dear .
I know Frederick .	it wouldn't be fair to Elizabeth .
what ?	I say , it wouldn't be fair to you ... or to me .
nor to Elizabeth .	no . nor to Elizabeth .
and Elizabeth has hers .	yes , Elizabeth has hers .
but , after all , you have yours .	yes , I have mine .
and I have mine .	yes ... yes , you have yours .
why don't we talk inside ?	well ... ... perhaps for a few minutes .
yes , I know .	it wouldn't be fair to her .
yes , I know .	you've got to help me to remain faithful .
yes , I will .	... But an intellectual relationship , like this -- we could have as often as we wanted . three times a day -- anything !

Bucharest ? ? ? this was always a hick town . they can't get a' bus and Truck' company to come in here . are you going to let these idiots get the best of you ? ... Or are you going to stand up like a man and show them that you've got more dignity in your little finger than they've got in all their beer- bloated bodies put together ?
Frederick Frankenstein ?	Fron kon steen !
are you putting me on ?	no , it's pronounced Fron kon steen .
and do you also say Fro dereck ?	no , Fred ereck .
why isn't it Frodereck Fronkon steen ?	it's not . it's Fredereck Fronkonsteen .
I see .	you must be Igor .
no , it's pronounced Aye gor .	but they told me it was Ee gor .
well , they were wrong then , weren't they ?	you were sent by Herr Falkstein , weren't you ?
yes , that's right . my grandfather and your grandfather used to pal around together . you and I should have a lot of laughs .	I'm sure we will .
this is Inga . they thought you might need an assistant temporarily .	how do you do ?
are these your bags ?	yes , just the two .
incidentally -- I don't mean to embarrass you in any way , but I'm a rather brilliant surgeon . perhaps I can help you with that hump .	what hump ?
there .	I beg your pardon ?
why are you talking like that ?	I thought you wanted to .
no .	suit yourself ... I'm easy . better watch out for the wockers .
what wockers ?	the wockers with the knockers .
Wockers with the knockers ? ? ?	go ahead , play dumb ! you'll lose your sockers and then be fockers .
down ! get down , you beasts !	I wonder what's got into them ?
Aye-gor !	Fro-derick !
what are you doing here ?	I got frightened all alone upstairs , so I came down here .
but what you were doing ?	just putting up some tea .
did you hear that strange music ?	what ?
did you hear that strange music ? ?	what ?
it seems that way . you didn't hear any music at all ?	what ?
you didn't hear ... nothing ! aren't there any lights in this place ?	two switches over there , but I wasn't going to be the first .
did you see anyone else down here ?	no , but when I first came in , there was a light coming from behind that steel door .
what is this place ?	must be the music room .
it is ! this was my grandfather's private library . look at this !	&apos; how I Did It .' good title !
taking the book along ?	yes , I think we could all use a good laugh .
what a filthy job !	could be worse !
how ?	could be raining !
I have a pretty good idea .	do you have the name I wrote down ?
yes . Dr. H. Delbruck .	I want that brain .
was he any good ?	was he any good ? ? ? he was the finest natural philosopher , internal medicine diagnostician and chemical therapist of this century .
hmm !	and he wrote seventeen cookbooks .
that's not bad .	can you imagine that brain in this body ?
I'm getting excited just thinking about it . what if he's not there ?	he only died two weeks ago -- I'm sure they'll still have him . hurry now . I'll prepare the body .
oh ! may I call you' Master' ?	why ?
it's always been one of my favorite names .	if you like -- just hurry !
yes ! it's all written down in the notes . tie off the kites and come down !	yes , master . just don't turn on any radios .
you'd better hurry -- I think it's going to rain .	all right ... elevate me !
the ancient masters promised impossibilities and performed nothing . we shall penetrate into the recesses of nature . we shall ascend into the Heavens . we shall command the thunders of Heaven , mimic the earthquake and even mock the invisible world with its own shadows .	tonight ?
yes ! when I give the word -- throw the first switch !	you've got it , master .
throw the second switch !	this guy means business .
it's not enough . more ! more , do you hear me ?	what ?
what ?	throw the third switch !
you can't win' em all .	but there must be a reason . this is science , not art .
cold ! cold and dead !	you mustn't take it so hard . Bucharest wasn't built in a day .
don't try to cheer me up that way .	well , I don't like to see you mope .
you'll be getting me sad next .	I'm sorry . I don't mean to take out my frustration on you . you've been a great help to me , and I've let you down .
I'm not that sort you know . I appreciate you feelings , but try to show them some other way .	you're right ! self-pity never got anyone anywhere . let's go back and finish our dinner .
oh , do you like it ? I'm not partial to desserts , but this is excellent .	who are you talking to ?
to you ! you just made a' yummy' sound , so I thought you liked the dessert .	I didn't make a' yummy' sound -- I just asked what it was .
but you did -- I just heard it .	it wasn't me .
better not get too close , master . this guy could kill you .	I suppose you're right . Inga ! prepare a sedative , just in case .
it's trying to talk. it wants us to take off the straps .	don't fall for that one .
original .	give -- me -- your -- hand !
Whew ! I'm glad that's over with .	you can say that again .
yes .	you're just supposed to repeat what you said .
what's the point of my setup ? it's not funny unless you repeat exactly what you said .	I'm not trying to be funny .
repeat it anyway -- it's a wonderful cue .	... I'm glad that's ...
no , no ! that whole thing !	... Whew ! I'm glad that's over with .
it seem to have stopped the big fellow in his tracks .	Ayegor ! find out where that music is coming from as quietly and as blindingly fast as you can .
yes , Master !	act casual !
how's it going ?	what did you find out ?
someone was playing this in the music room .	where is he ?
all right -- where is she ?	how do you know it was a' she' ?
bring -- me -- the -- violin !	can you play it ?
thanks ... for all your help .	that's what we're paid for .
I'm a failure .	come on , Froderick -- none of that .
what monster ?	"what d'ya mean "" What monster ?' you remember ... the one we madein the basement ."
you don't understand , Master . the big fellow's broken in and kidnapped your fiancee .	what ? ? ?
that sound good , boss .	... and equalize the imbalance in his cerebrospinal fluid ...
I like your style , master . how do we get him here ?	there's only one way .
is everything ready ?	yes , master . are you sure you want to go through with it ?
it's the only way .	okay , boss ! but I hope you know what you're doing .
that's' Fronkonsteen .'	I beg your pardon ?
my name is pronounced Fron kon steen .	oh ! I thought it was Dr. Frankenstein .
but aren't you the grandson of the famous Dr. Victor Frankenstein ? ... who performed such fascinating experiments in electricity and galvanism ?	that's true ! but my grandfather , Victor was , after all , what we might politely refer to as ... a cuckoo !
I prefer , by far , to be remembered for my own small contributions to science . now if we can proceed to your questions .	well sir ... I'm not sure I understand the distinction between' Reflexive' and' voluntary' nerve impulses .
Dr. Fronkonsteen !	yes ?
isn't it true that Darwin preserved a piece of vermicelli in a glass case until , by some extraordinary means , it actually began to move with voluntary motion ?	a piece of what ?
Vermicelli .	are you speaking of the worm , or ... the spaghetti .
but wasn't that the whole basis of your grandfathers work , sir ... ? the re-animation of component parts ?	my father was a sick man .
but aren't you the least bit curious about it , Doctor ? doesn't the secret of life hold any intrigue for you ?	you are talking about the gibberish ravings of a lunatic mind .
yes , but , sir ... if it could be accomplished , wouldn't that eliminate disease from the human frame and render man invulnerable to any but a violent death ?	how old are you , young man ?
nineteen , sir .	nineteen ! my dear young man ... once the human organism has ceased to function , nature has deemed that creature to be dead .
but look at what's been done with hearts and kidneys !	hearts and kidneys are Tinker Toys ! I'm talking about the Central Nervous System .
but , sir ...	I am a scientist ... ! not a philosopher .
you have more chance of re-animating this knife than you have of mending a broken nervous system ,	but your grandfather's work , sir ...
Dr. Frankenstein ?	Fron kon steen !
oh , at least , sir . the land alone is worth a small fortune .	but I can't just drop everything and leave . I have responsibilities and obligations .
do you have a hundred thousand of them , sir ?	how long will this whole thing take ?
a week . ten days at most .	I'll have to think it over . it's not so easy just to pick up and ...
well ... if you're sure that I could accomplish everything in a week ... I suppose I could manage it .	why did you do that ?
break that old man's violin .	I didn't do that .
all right then , I suppose I owe the family that much . you'll have everything ready for me when I arrive ?	yes , sir .
one week at the most ! ?	one week -- I'll see to it , sir .
well , thank you very much for all your trouble .	not at all -- a great privilege , Doctor .
Saturday night then ! I'll take the train to New York and fly from there .	Saturday night , yes , sir . have a pleasant journey !
I hope you find this comfortable . this was Baron Victor's room .	it seems fine .
you'll fine the keys to all the rooms in my cas ... all the rooms in your castle on this ring . I'll leave it on the table here .	does that include the key to the laboratory ?
you mean ... the laboratory ? ?	yes ! ... the laboratory .
there seem to be quite a few books .	yes , this was Victor's ... the Baron's medical library .
I see . and where is my grandfather's private library ?	I don't know what you mean , sir .
well , there was a public and a private library -- he said so in his will. these books are all very general -- any doctor might have them in his study .	this is the only library I know of .
surely he kept his notes -- his private papers and records in some other place ?	I think you must be mistaken , sir .
well ... we'll see .	will there be anything else ?
I don't think so . is my assistant taken care of ?	I put her in the guest room , just down the hall .
this wire came while you were gone . your fiancee will be arriving any moment .	Elizabeth ! ? !' can't waits any longer . arrive in your arms at ten tonight .' oh , God ! not tonight .
darling ! ... you will be careful ! ?	of course .
you have your tickets ?	yes .
and your passport ?	yes , don't worry .
call me from New York before you leave ? ?	yes .
promise ? ?	I promise .
oh , darling -- I'll count the hours that you're away .	oh , darling -- so will I.
will you miss me ?	very .... very !
mother's going to help me with the invitations .	oh , nice .
I hope you like large weddings .	whatever makes you happy .
I've trimmed the list to only our very closest friends ... but it still comes to three thousand .	you're incorrigible !
does that mean you love me ?	you bet your boots it does .
I will ! goodbye , darling !	goodbye , darling .
goodbye , darling .	goodbye , darling !
darling !	darling !
surprised ?	surprised !
love me ?	love you ! ... Well , why don't we turn in ?
darling ! ? !	I mean , it's been a long day . I'm sure you must be as tired as I am . oh ! these are my assistants : Inga and Ayegor .
ready , darling ?	yes . I am a bit tired , after all .
what a strange fellow .	yes , he's a little bit ... tilted . harmless , though .
why does he call you' master' ?	are you suggesting I call him master ? ? ?
no , of course not . I just meant ...	all right then !
poor Delbruck ! there must be some way to reach him -- to control that body .	darling , you mustn't worry so .
but there's a genius inside that body -- crying out for love and understanding and normal human relationships . I just have to find some way to re-establish his communications system .	but you can't do that at night . and even if you could -- it would cost a fortune . come to bed , darling .
oh , Delbruck , Delbruck . was will dien tachlas von Dir ?	you've done everything that's humanly possible , Frederick . oh , darling , I'm so worried about you -- you need rest .
I suppose you're right .	of course I am . now come along like a good boy .
is your room just down the hall ? ... in case I get frightened during the night ?	yes , but ... I thought , perhaps tonight , under the circumstances , I might ... stay here with you .
I don't want to spoil anything -- I just want to top it all off .	would you want me , now , like this , so soon before our wedding ? ... So near we can almost touch it ? or wait a little while longer , when I can give myself without hesitation ? ... When I can be totally and unashamedly yours ? ?
that's a tough choice .	is it worth taking a chance ?
I suppose you're right .	of course I am . now give me a kiss and say good night like my good boy .
good night .	that's my good boy .
darling !	hello ... ?
surprised ?	well ... yes .
Miss me ?	I ...
what in God's name are you doing ?	Baack !
what ?	Baack !
you're incorrigible ! ... Aren't you ?	MMMmmmm .
mmmmm !	is it that music ?
did you see ? ... I put a special hamper in the bathroom just for your shirts. the other one is just for socks and poo-poo undies .	mmmmm .
still happy you married me ?	mmmmm .
love me oodles and oodles ?	mmmmm .
so this is what it's like to be completely happy !	mmmmm .
Herr Falkstein ! did you inform Frederick Frankenstein of this assembly and all the particulars of the time and place ?	I did , sir .
but I received a cable only this morning , saying that he could not come .	was he aware of the importance of this occasion ?
yes , sir , he was . but he said he was obligated to lecture at Johns Hopkins University .	what lecture could be more important than the will of Baron Beaufort Frankenstein ?
&apos; functional areas of the cerebrum in relation to the skull .'	Herr Falkstein ! you have your instructions !
yes , sir .	I have taken an oath that each letter of this Testament shall be executed ... and by God , it shall be done !
where did you get this cauliflower ?	from your office , sir .
didn't you prepare it with the celery before my lecture ?	yes , sir . but I must have taken the wrong one when we came up .
are you trying to make me look like an idiot ?	no , sir . it will never happen again .
give him an extra dollar .	yes , sir .
yes , sir .	he has a big mouth . yes ! it seems to me I did read something about that incident as a student . but you have to remember that a worm -- with very few exceptions -- is not a human being .
Carlson !	yes , sir ?
bring me some surgical gauze , a little tape and some disinfectant .	yes , sir . do you want the other cauliflower ?
... No !	Frederick Frankenstein ?
you have the wrong house .	and who might you be ?
Dr. Frederick Fronkonsteen .	the grandson of Victor' Fronkonsteen' ?
no !	what was your grandfather's name ?
Victor Frankenstein .	forgive me for intruding so late at night , Herr Baron . but an ugly rumor has it that there are strange goings on in this castle . these good citizens are ready to rip you from limb to limb unless you can offer some rational explanation for their fears . how say you ?
ugly , vicious rumous .	they say , also , that you have recreated the horrible monster who , for so many years , has haunted and terrorized the God-fearing people of this village . what say you to that ?
I think we all need a good night's sleep . why don't we meet next week and thrash this thing out ?	now wait a minute !
yes , my dear , he is .	and has he achieved ... any special degree of eminence ?
he is the fifth leading authority in his field .	oh , shit .
I'll never understand your regard for them , Charles .	and I'll never understand terrorists .
I am trying to save our kind , Charles . you should do the same .	not at the cost of lives , Max .
is that so ?	still trying to make the world safe for our kind . still trying to find a way to introduce ourselves -- definitively .
you definition of definitive was always a bit extreme for me , Max . what is it like these days ?	let's just say that I am out to make some radical changes . now come on Charles . for old times sake , for your sake ... Leave him to me .
if I could make you understand . if you could just be made to see it the way I do . the way it's going to be .	the way what is going to be ?
I'm going to change the world with or without you as a witness , Charles . and this one gets a front row seat .	what do you mean to do ?
this checkmate goes to you . I didn't want to hurt anyone . but you leave me no choice .	what DO YOU MEAN TO DO ?
I wouldn't really have let you die , you know . I just needed ...	I know .
doesn't it ever wake you in the middle of the night ? the feeling that some day , some day very soon , they will pass that foolish law - or one just like it - and they will come for you and your children ? take you all away ?	it does indeed , Max .
and what do you do when you wake up to that ?	I feel a great swell of pity for the poor soul who comes to that school again looking for trouble .
I lost him .	how ?
is that what you're looking for ?	a piece . only a piece .
is it enough ?	enough for a test .
I'll find him .	alive .
why is everybody up at sunrise ?	the sun is setting , Logan . you've been asleep for nineteen hours .
what did she do to me ?	she borrowed your power to save her life . when she touches someone , she absorbs their strengths -- their gifts . in your case -- your ability to heal . that's why she keeps her body covered .
I felt like she almost killed me .	if she held on any longer she could have .
what am I doing here ?	I brought you here so that you would be safe from magneto .
who ?	a very powerful mutant who for some reason has taken an interest in you . I'm not sure why , but until we find out , I must ask you to stay .
forty-eight hours , old man . but if you cross me , I won't feel any guilt about what I do to you .	deal .
the point of what ?	"this . this whole God damn thing . making yourselves into some sort of "" team "" of super-powered freaks . teaching wayward mutants about classical literature . for what ?"
the point is to step into a more evolved position of social responsibility . to recognize that there is a world out there and that we mutants are as much a part of it as normal human beings .	what if it never happens ? what if they're so afraid of us that we become the enemy ? -- This place is gonna be one giant cemetery .
now that's magneto talking .	no . that's me talking . and you know what ? it's only been thirty-two hours and you still have no idea what this guy wants with me .
where are we going ?	to find Rogue .
how ?	the brainwaves of mutants are quite different than those of the average human being .
you designed this yourself ?	actually , magneto helped me put it together .
he helped you ?	we were friends once ... But that was a long time ago .
they're all asking how you're doing . are you feeling up to saying hello to everyone ?	actually I'm feeling up to leaving .
why ? you have a home here now , if you want it . everyone will ...	what ? ... miss me ? Charley , I'm gonna walk out the front door and trust me , it won't be soon enough for everyone here .
I do love a good check mate .	what do you want ?
come with me and I'll let her live .	you think I care about her ? I'm the only one who's sure to walk out of here .
where am I ?	you're backstage at the encore of creation .
you ... wha ... Who are you ... Where is Henry ?	Mr. Guyrich has been dead for some time Senator .
the intention of registration act -	intention ? intention , Senator ? we are talking about mankind here . his fear . it is only a matter of time before mutants will be herded into camps . studied for weaknesses . and eventually wiped off the face of the Earth .
what is it you intend to do to me ?	let's just say , God works too slowly .
you're avoiding the question I posed to you at the beginning of the hearing , Ms. Grey . three words : are mutants dangerous ?	I am avoiding a question that is decidedly loaded , Senator . the wrong person behind the wheel of a car can be dangerous .
Ms. Grey -- you work at a school for mutants in Westchester , New York . can you tell the members of this committee what exactly you are teaching these mutants ?	math . history . science . English . Athletics --
you wouldn't happen to be teaching them how to use their powers to --	control , Senator ... we teach them control .
this was taken by a state police officer in Secaucus , New Jersey . a man in a minor altercation literally melted the car in front of him . I don't know where you come from , Ms. Grey , but where I come from , you don't go melting people's cars when they cut you off . you do it the old fashioned way -- you give' em the finger . but what you presume to tell this committee -	I presume nothing , I am here to tell you that in time , the mutator gene will activate in every living human being on this planet . perhaps even your children , Senator .
I'm sorry to come here , Ms. Grey . I was afraid if I went to a hospital , they would ...	treat you like a mutant ? we are not what you think . not all of us .
tell it to the ones that did this to me .	the mutant gene tells the body when it needs to change .
some cigars . case of beer .	there's no smoking or drinking on the school grounds .
I won't light the cigars - how about that ?	I'll see what I can do -- You should get some sleep . even with your healing ability , you're going to be hurting for a while .
what if I like the pain ?	the Professor said you were a solider . actually , I believe he used the word mercenary .
yeah ? well I don't like to talk about my past .	maybe , the Professor could help you with that .
by reading my thoughts ?	if necessary .
you should always work with a spotter .	he's busy right now .
were you now ?	what do you say ?
he takes his work seriously .	he takes himself seriously .
Logan , do you see this ring ?	I've seen a lot of rings .
inspiring -- Now what am I doing here ?	I wanted to talk to you .
how long have you been in Alaska ?	I don't remember . is that what you wanted to ask me ?
I've served with men like you before . methodical . Systematic -- naive . you know what happens to those men in a real fight ?	you know , you --
I'm o.k. I'm o.k.	sure you are , sport .
Scott .. I -	I don't like him being here .
what are you talking about ?	you saw what happened tonight . you think magneto won't come after him again . you think he won't come here if necessary . this is a school , for God's sake .
what's wrong with him ?	his vital signs are weak and getting weaker .
he's already losing control of his vitals . respiratory . cardiovascular . unless we manage to replace the filter by tomorrow morning , I'm afraid .	we have to find magneto .
are you all right ?	no . I'm ... I don't know if we can do this without Charles .
hey . I'm sorry . about Logan . I was jealous .	well , I think that's perfectly understandable .
I'll tell you one thing though .	what's that ?
radar Stealth mode checks out . all right , there'll be less security north of the George Washington Bridge . I'm taking her down .	into the Hudson ?
I'm going to assume that means that the Secret Service is out of commission . Jean , can you raise me up there ?	it's too far .
I'm sorry . I'm not strong enough .	can the Professor repair his own mind ?
correct ... Apparently , Adamantium is the only metal strong enough to hold the energy this machine produces . he used the Adamantium in Logan's dog tag to test it on the Senator . and I assume now he plans to use the rest of Logan's skeleton for a larger demonstration .	for what purpose ?
yes -- Only there's a problem . the mutator gene is not responding to the radiation the way it would in mother nature . it's forcing the body's cells to replicate thousands of times faster than they're accustomed to . the Senator's body is literally burning itself out . Scott -- this machine kills people and I don't think magneto realizes it .	so where do you think he's planning this larger demonstration ?
what does that mean ?	the neuro-filter acts like a surge Protector , regulating the infinite flow of information from Cerebro to the Professor's mind . it's what keeps him from being crushed by the consciousness of millions .
Thomas Edison knew how to make the light bulb . he had the energy source . he had the vacuum . but he didn't have the filament . he tried metal after metal but nothing would hold to power .	... until he found tungsten .
I wish I could go .	we all do .
storm . try to look for the highest vantage point . from what I can figure , he'll need to gain as much altitude as possible to blanket the island . it is my feeling that magneto has to--	beast .
that's the guy .	this pizda ? never seen him before .
cops . like a plague . no matter how many you pay there's always another with his hand out . how did you pick him out ?	he flashed his badge to half the bar when he bought his drink .
I appreciate you bringing this to our attention . whatever you want , the rest of the night , consider it on the house .	thanks , but I'm here on business . I heard you're the G around here . I'm looking for some cars , expensive ones . a lot of them .
sorry , man , don't know what you're talking about .	I'm talking about the sports cars that disappear off the docks in Genoa and wind up here . if you don't know about' em , who does ?
I remember that one where you jump the motorcycle over the freeway at rush hour .	when else are you gonna do it ?
I'm somewhat less so . we seem to have a bit of a problem ...	I had to inspect the merchandise first .
of course .	what's this ?
what's going on , my friend ?	you tell me ! you got a sniper up there or what ?
he's not with us , Xander . he must be with you .	bullshit ! you get your boy off that roof or I swear to God I'm gonna give you another hole to breathe out of .
total chaos , man ! welcome to anarchy 99 !	"what's "" anarchy 99 "" ?"
it's all this craziness ! it's what we've been living since 99 , when we left the Army . one of our brothers died in Grozny and we said the hell with this shit . what for ? he dies for what ? politics ? who's politics ? not ours .	you wanna see my politics ?
screw the world . if I'm gonna die for something , it better be bitches and money .	that's what I'm talking about , man ! that's why anarchy 99 was born .
""" ... try walking into a deli and urinating on the cheese "" .' anarchy Burger' by the Vandals ."	you got it , man . it's stupid but it's true . true freedom is when you do whatever you want anytime you want . that's when you know you're living , man .
how you gonna do that with government and rules everywhere ?	easy . you get enough money that you grow an ass big enough for the whole world to kiss .
you got a great set-up here Yorgi . you really know how to live .	it's a beautiful town , Prague . it's been good to me .
I've been here before , when I was a kid . my old man was in the service , we used to live on the Army base in Hamburg .	you , an Army brat ? I don't see that one at all . did you join the service as well ?
hell no . my dad was a straight up tin soldier . somehow he pissed this general off and got himself dishonorably discharged . had a court martial and everything . the charges were total bullshit , so he was sure he'd get his name cleared , but it didn't happen .	connections and politics , it's the same everywhere .
I've got meetings this afternoon , I've got to get some sleep . just pick a girl .	that's alright , I'm kinda tired .
and you . why do you have such a problem staying away , my friend ? did you miss us that much ?	I wanted to get the hell out of Prague before silent Night falls .
what's the gimmick , Yorgi ? that's the part I don't get . you gonna hold the world hostage with your gas bombs ? I didn't think you were dumb enough to go with that hack cliche .	you think I'm after money ? I told you , my friend . anarchy . time for a change . money is good , but for true freedom you have to get rid of the rules themselves .
so all by yourself , you're going to destroy every government ; in the world .	easier than that , buddy . I'll get them to destroy each other . you kill an entire Peace conference , someone is going to have to pay . then our friend Ahab continues down the river to the ocean and begins his world tour . London , Cairo , Beijing ... Pretty soon everyone's involved . these guys bomb those guys , those guys invade these guys . soon the whole world is like your wild West cowboy days . no rules , no law , everybody free to do what they want .
including rape , pillage , murder .	sure , if that's what you want . why not ? it's all human nature . so we just have to launch our baby and wait for the decline and fall of civilization as we know it .
"and here I thought "" anarchy "" was just something cool to put on a Tshirt ."	come on , Xander . you used to stand for something . what happened to you , man ? I thought you'd get it .
you both could have been a part of it . you could have ridden with us into a new day , the dawning of a new age of --	oh just shoot us already . I'm sorry I asked .
what's so damn funny ?	been to any good diners lately ?
who's writing this dude's dialogue ?	he's a pretty good actor , though .
help me with this guy .	it's like you said , every man for himself .
they're all over the place ! what the hell's going on ?	looks like we're in the middle of the drug war .
sit down .	I've been on a plane for twelve hours , I think I'll stand .
my name is Slovo , Czech secret police . when you are here you are under my jurisdiction , you take my orders , you do what I say . if you become any kind of an inconvenience , I'll shoot you .	here we go again .
nice hops .	the corner . anarchy 99 .
Dude , what are you doing here ?	you killed me , remember ? now I have to hide out here with you . where have you been ?
I found something big enough for us to take these guys down with . they've got a of nerve agent they're gonna unleash .	is this what you're looking for ?
"sorry , "" dude "" ."	what's the deal ?
why you dogging me up ?	they came and found me . they said they'd kill me unless I help them . plus they offer me a lot of money . no big deal . these things happen . dump your gun on the floor .
hey , you don't need all this just to go on vacation . unless this ain't for going on vacation ...	I'm through , Xander .
I can see that . why ?	you run around with maniacs jumping motorcycles in the desert , you break 36 bones crashing wave runners and snowboarding off cliffs , all with no health insurance ... It's insane , I can't take it anymore .
I'm having fun , what's the problem ?	"you have all this talent , and you waste it . you won't take a single endorsement deal . meanwhile those other guys have their own video games ! but no , you've got too much "" integrity "" for that ."
French Polynesia ? this wouldn't last us a week in a cheap hotel . do you know how expensive it is down there ?	alright , so I'll get more .
it's not about the money , X ! you never plan for anything . I can't live like that anymore , I need some stability .	well if you're bailing , I guess I'd better give you your surprise now .
what ... ?	I was gonna wait till the islands , but ...
you're serious ?	of course I'm serious . I bought it , didn't I ?
this is so typical . I can't believe you . I've barely seen you for the last three weeks and now this ? are you out of your mind ?	I don't know . I thought this is what you wanted . you want stability , here it is .
you can't just propose to me out of nowhere . you think that's going to solve our problems ? I'm sorry , X. It was a kick for a while , but it's over . you're just not going anywhere .	"you're not exactly "" going anywhere "" yourself ."
hate those Russkie choppers . Rattle- trap pieces of garbage . I'm agent Shavers . Toby Lee Shavers . I'm looking for what's his name . three X' s .	that's would be me .
back off , just go away you Klutz . alright , here's the story . the items in these cases belong to me . I designed them , built them , and was going to use them in the field myself until you showed up .	I stole your beat , huh ? guess you forgot to brown-nose the right people .
is that supposed to be funny ? I'm not laughing . I've worked for ten years to get my shot at being a field agent , funny boy . and ar the last minute I get bumped by you , some reject from the Ozzfest .	why don't you show me some gear before you get hurt .
miniature power cams set in on contact , giving you a sure grip on any surface .	they come in any other styles or colors ?
this is your standard dart gun .	that one I'm real familiar with .
I think I'll hang on to these .	think again , that's government property . you have to sign for everything . I've got one more that wasn't on your list .
from the Beastie Boys collection ?	it's a stakeout suit . it's got food , water , recording gear , anything you need for covert spying . it's all- weather , fire retardant , and if you give this buckle a sharp pull , the whole outfit deploys into a parachute .
you're joking , right ?	now that I've given you the overview , we're going to spend the next couple hours going into extensive operational detail .
nothing . he had two days .	perhaps he is not all he says he is .
what are you doing ?	it all happened so fast . such an unfortunate accident .
what was that for ?	I'd forgotten how exciting it is working together .
you've been so quiet lately , Petra , I thought you no longer cared .	why don't we go below decks and work off some of this adrenaline .
Viktor ! stay the course .	the Peace conference ...
ten is hardly worth the effort . we're talking a lousy million five U.S.	I have Japanese buyers who are looking to move a fleet , if you have the quality of merchandise they're after . and it's a mil two , max .
do you know what a wire transfer is ?	is she for real ? honey , maybe you should quiet down and let the grownups have a conversation .
my goodness , a word with four syllables . I should get some ice before your brain gets too hot .	sure . just chisel some off your heart .
if you got a problem with me , why are we dancing ?	Yorgi asked me to .
you do everything Yorgi says ?	go to hell .
it's gonna be like that , huh ? you got all bent out of shape as soon as he started dancing with someone else . why's that ?	mind your business .
why are you still hanging around ? your business is finished , you should go home .	I was invited . what's your story ?
I don't know who you are or where you come from , but I don't like you . you ask too many questions .	come on , don't front like that . you'll put a guy right off you .
don't even bother , X man , I'm not your type .	that right ? why's that ?
who are you ?	we hung out last night , remember ?
I also remember you drove your car here . who are you really ? make no mistake , I will shoot you and not feel bad about it . who are you working for ?	hey , take it easy . I'm just a dude trying to make a buck .
bullshit . I see you look at everything , study everything , ask questions . I know exactly what you're doing . empty your pockets .	you've got to relax , baby , you're paranoid .
hey , you're good .	maybe we should start again , yes ? I know so little about you , except that you're not what you say you are .
I don't know what you're talking about .	the eyes don't lie . all this has gotten to you , hasn't it , Petra ? you came in as Yorgi's girlfriend and you stayed because it was fun . now you don't like it so much , but you're in so deep you can't get out anymore . tell me if I'm wrong , Petra .
go to hell !	look at you . you're helping run things now . you're a gangster . I bet that snuck up on you . you woke up one day and you were a criminal .
what are you ?	I'm an information gatherer . you wanna go somewhere and talk about it ?
that's how you eat ? it's like a gerbil .	I'm from L.A.
so why don't you tell me something about who you gather information for . they obviously have very deep pockets . are you from a rival clan ?	let's just say I'm freelancing and leave it at that .
whoever sent you knew what they were doing . you and Yorgi are practically twins . two nihilistic fashion victims who make a lot of noise but don't say much .	don't judge a comic book by it's cover .
I know where he's coming from . the only thing I really don't get is why he dumped you . up until I found that out , I thought his judgment was pretty sound .	don't even start . I'll be honest , I don't trust you . Bur lets pretend for a minute that what you say is true , that I want to leave . what can you do about it ?
the people I know want facts , the kinds of things an insider would know . they're interested in putting anarchy 99 out of business .	all I have to do is risk my life providing you with these facts .
we could work together . then maybe we could both get the hell out of here . there's a beach in Bora Bora with my name on it .	a beach named X ? that I'd like to see .
they tell me you're an American agent .	what are you talking about ?
there's no more time for games . they made you . there's a sniper out front waiting to put a bullet in your eye . tell me if it's true .	it's a long story , but yeah , more or less .
Jesus Christ . you're going to have to go out the back . the data that you copied with your toy . tomorrow , at six o'clock . look it up . we're taking a trip . be there at six and you'll have plenty to tell your people .	if I go out the back , he'll know you've warned me .
that's alright , I'll figure something out .	not an option . just get up slowly like everything's cool . Petra , trust me . you just hung yourself out to dry for me , I'm not gonna let you down .
I can't let this happen . I want you to go out the back . I'll make up some excuse .	they'll kill you , you know they will . besides , there is no back door . keep smiling . ready ? now .
so what's the plan with this Ahab ? are they selling it or what ?	no , something worse . he says it's a surprise , but I know him . this is his masterpiece .
we've got to find out what it is . can you handle that ?	there's something I didn't have time to tell you before .
what's that ?	I'm a agent as well . KGB . I've been undercover for over a year .
you're what ? what the hell have you been doing ?	I don't know . eight months ago I stop hearing from my people . no explanation , just silence . so I stay and I wait like I was told . soon I'm in so far , they'd kill me if I left . now every day I get farther and farther away from what I was . I'm like you said , a criminal .
I'm busted up for you , but Jesus , what the hell are you doing ? those people almost drowned on that boat and you didn't lift a finger .	no , I guess I've been no help at all to you .
get your head back in the game . there are lives at stake here .	of course . I'll do what I can . I have to go , before they notice .
when can I see you again ?	you can't , it's too risky . I'm not much help anyway , remember ?
are you alright ?	what the hell are you doing ? you could've killed me !
I heard you talking . I could tell where you were in the room .	I don't know what's going on anymore . I thought I was square with that dude . now everybody's switching sides like it's the WWF .
what are you doing with the Ivans ?	I know which cops are good and which are bad . come with me . come on , right now .
we're getting out of this place . we've done enough .	wait a minute , whoa . we can't go now . what's Yorgi got planned with that nerve agent ?
it doesn't matter anymore , forget it .	of course it matters . hey , hold on !
what do we owe our governments ? yours kidnapped you , mine abandoned me .	Petra , this ain't about the people that sent us here , you know that .
no , now it's about us . let's do something for us before we both get killed . don't you want to get to Bora Bora , Xander ?	we can't leave now . we have to do something .
they left . to a fortress in the mountains .	we'll have to go after them .
aren't you afraid ?	a long time ago I learned how to put fear away in a little place in my head . maybe that's my problem . if you don't feel fear you can do some amazing things , but you can also screw your life up in ways you can't imagine .
I must be healthy , then , because I'm scared to death . I guess I'd better get back to Yorgi .	you don't have to do that .
yes , I do . you're right . I can't just let him go free . besides , I can help you from the inside .	aren't they gonna wonder were you've been ?
I was supposed to wait for the cop to kill you and then kill the cop . they'll believe me . I've been lying for so long , one more time won't hurt .	when this is over , we're just gonna take off , the two of us . take a vacation .
he's a regular humanitarian . and all this time I thought he was just a tool .	Yorgi and Kirill .
did you do your homework ?	if they launch it , I know how to bring it back .
where'd the damn truck go ? !	go to the water , it's that way !
Toadies right behind .	let me .
you okay ?	a piece of shrapnel hit me .
he's shut out the communication circuit !	you can't talk to it ?
no , it's like a safety . we are going to have to access the manual controls .	a manual control on a moving torpedo . this day keeps getting better and better .
it's running three meters down . twenty knots .	it has to surface to release the nerve agent , right ?
by then it's too late ! the only way to safely dispose of the nerve agent is in deep water ! the chemicals will break down and dissipate !	use your grenades ! maybe we can blow it up underwater !
I can't believe my mission is finally over . I don't even know what to do with myself .	you can't welch on me now . we had a deal .
what are you doing ?	it's about your next mission . you need to be debriefed .
what game is that ?	"slick graphics , huh ? see these dudes ? they're called "" anarchy 99 "" , they're the bad guy bosses ."
do they have any special powers ? the bosses always have special powers .	you wanna check it out ? come here .
next we got a Siberian redneck , Viktor . into snowmobiles and snowboarding . so naturally , he covers prostitution and the drug trade .	naturally .
this guy's kinda dorky lookin' .	"Kirill , the sniper . looks like a bookworm , but he had 72 confirmed kills in Chechnya , they called him the "" finger of God "" . assassination and weapons ."
"Yorgi masterminded the take-over of three Red Mafiya clans . cops called it "" blood week "" . he combined all of their global enterprises into one huge crime syndicate : anarchy 99 ."	""" anarchy "" 99 "" ?"
what are you gonna do ? they're Euro- trash .	what weapons do you have ?
just about anything I want , it looks like . this is gonna be tough , though . there's no way to save this game . I gotta get it right the first time through .	what do you get if you finish ?
nothing , really . my guy is just doing it to stay alive .	oh . I bet by the end he gets something out of it .
like what ?	he gets to be the hero .
Whatchu doing here ?	oh , I don't know . it was an accident .
we're on to the game , ese . you got the fake blood splattered all over the walls , you got your torture tools ... It's all very cute . but come on , let's quit while you're ahead . I'm only trying to save you a beatin' .	you saving me ? you talking pretty tough for a guy got himself chained to the ceiling .
alright . you wanna eat through a tube , be my guest .	now you're gonna make me enjoy this , funny guy . now I'm gonna take the whole foot off . Whatchu think of that ?
what do you have ?	"not a whole helluva lot . his final transmission was mangled . about something or someone called "" Ahab "" . whatever it is , it cost him his life ."
he was the best there was . that makes three agents lost .	they're ruthless and they have a lot of firepower . it's only a matter of time before they figure out how to deploy silent Night . then we're gonna have a catastrophe on our hands .
silent Night in the hands of a bunch of impertinent cowboys	we're gonna have to step in , Sam . those CIA boys couldn't find a clown in a field of cactus . let me take care of it .
how will you fix it ?	I'll go in with a team . but first I'm going to need some intel . I'll have to put someone inside , someone new , someone they won't see coming . one of their own .
so you'll dredge the bottom again . you've done that before . the results were ... uneven .	you wanna find out about rats , ask a rat . I've had my people put together a talent pool . I downloaded it to your desktop .
the usual prospects . convicts , contract killers , murde ...	the scum of the Earth .
but programmable . and expendable .	I've seen enough . turn it off .
they're degenerates . there's not a man in there that would give a damn if the Chinese took over .	that's exactly why we need them .
ridiculous . cut him off . I'm sorry Gibbons , you pulled up a shark this time .	I think we should send him whatever he wants .
you what ? a wire transfer of this size ?	if it means getting silent Night back , absolutely .
you're talking about a very expensive risk here .	he's gotten closer in 24 hours than all of the other operatives combined . he got us an account number to boot . now even if he's just dumb and lucky , I say we back his play . I put him out there , Sam . if he doesn't come up with the money , they'll kill him . I can't let that happen .
the name's Gibbons . you were saying ?	what is this place ?
looks like a diner .	"diner , huh ? let me tell you what the problem is . I wake up drugged to find what ? you've got a "" salesman "" over here reading a three week old newspaper . he's pulling a 211 with a "" trucker "" , who happens to be packing a cop issue H &amp; K 9mm . I get tipped that something is going down when she passes me a note . how's that for twisted logic ? how did she know there was trouble unless they pulled the guns before I "" walked "" in ? and if that's true , why'd they stop and wait until I woke up to gaffle the money ? then I notice how beefy they both are . hell , even the waitress is cut . all three of them look like they went through the same training program . Ergo they ain't strangers and this isn't what it seems . that's how I knew yo-yo wouldn't get a round off even if I gave him all day . why ?"
most guys we ran through this either took off or helped them rob the place . I expected you to do the same .	that shows me already that you don't have a clue . what's it to you , anyway ?
whether you thought this was for real or not , you jumped in and helped the waitress on instinct . that tells me something about your character .	good for you . now why don't you stop wasting my time and tell me what you want . you didn't go through all this for my benefit .
it's your lucky day . you just might get the chance to pay back our wonderful country for all the freedom you enjoy .	a Fed , I shoulda known . who else would have this kind of budget ? now you're gonna hit me with the sales pitch .
"alright , cage , you've got me . this is one of those moments . "" many are called , few are chosen "" , that kind of thing . your government needs you . are you up for the challenge ?"	.. If you're trolling around for narcs , man , have you got the wrong guy .
why is that ?	look at me , dude , do I look like a fan of law enforcement ? forget the tests , you shoulda just asked me . I woulda saved you a lot of trouble .
oh I don't know , I think the tests work pretty well . sometimes they give me answers you wouldn't admit to in a million years .	are we done now ? you've got nothing on me . so if you ain't booking me , I'm walking .
you've got this wrong . you're not under arrest , you've been abducted . and until I say different , you belong to me .	is that a fact ?
sure as gravity . I've had a feeling about you from the start , cage . it's nausea .	you know what I hate ? any scumbag with a clean shirt and a bad haircut can get one of those tin stars and suddenly they think they're God .
congratulations , you've just graduated at the head of your class .	you're a cold piece of work . you almost got three people killed out there .
you want the cheap backstory ? the runaway mom , the suicide dad and the foster homes ? gimme a break . you're not interested in my past , you're interested in my future as some kind of spy .	you're perceptive too . I forgot to add that to the list of surprises . I'm with the National Security Agency . and unlikely as it may sound , I need your help .
I'm not interested . I've already got a job .	you're an adrenaline junkie with one foot in the penitentiary . you risk your ass building a daredevil myth that means nothing and you're not getting any younger .
I plan on getting a lot older . and playing spy games sounds like a quick way to get yourself dead .	that's too bad . I thought a guy like you would appreciate the challenge .
now I'm the one who's nauseous . so what's the deal ? what do you need me for ?	there's some folks I want to keep tabs on . dirty , tattooed , uncivilized . your kind of people .
what do I get out of it ?	if you find out what I want to know , and if I'm able to successfully use that information , you get to go back to your degenerate little life . if not , you take a bath .
how about a pedicure as long as you're down there . what's this ? Lo-Jack ?	wherever you go on the planet , I'll find you . there's no quitting . if you try to take it off , a ring of needles will inject enough curare into your bloodstream to kill you before you hit the ground . is all that clear ?
I expect you to call in regularly with progress reports .	fine , but I'm not gonna be no Bulldog Omega 5 .
up yours .	crude and defiant as always , triple X. It fits so well because you're obscene .
is that all ?	just remember , I'll be watching .
I guess you got my E-mail . I set up a purchase . ten cars .	if you're trying to push my buttons , you're on the right track . don't make me question my own judgment , X.
buddy , you sent me here to get close to their organization , that costs money .	one point two million dollars ? I did not authorize you to spend one point two million dollars !
we're not after car thieves here .	what the hell am I after ? you're telling me dick .
that information is classified . you're there to gather information on their operations , period .	call me crazy , but I thought hooking up a million dollar deal was a great way to get on their good side . what else ? you gonna hassle me about the weapons and spy stuff too ?
my friend , if you're planning on crossing me ...	I know , poison needles in my shins . you've got 36 hours . peace , out .
"you did say "" Ahab "" ? you're sure about that ?"	yeah , I sent you pictures . here's what I'm thinking . if they take out the cameras and sensors , they could probably put a bomb in this thing . you drop it in the water in the Red Sea and three weeks later it's swimming up the Potomac .
"this is good work , X , damn fine work . you need to press on at all costs , find out what they have planned with this "" Ahab "" ."	hey , one miracle at a time . they're on to me now , remember ?
thanks .	you're a grungy little Phoenix , you know that ? keep up the good work .
snow covered fortress . army of bad guys . the usual .	I'm on the way with a team to relieve you . what's the latest ?
yes it does .	come on , Gibbons , you can do better then that .
silent Night is the name of a top secret binary nerve agent . the glass canister is shot into the air and detonated . the black and white chemicals mix , forming a toxic cloud . when it settles down to Earth , it'll kill everything in the vicinity .	Jesus Christ , Gibbons , this is something we came up with ?
yeah , that's right . so now that you know , you understand why it's important that we get it back .	kinda funny , though , isn't it ? we're not supposed to be making weapons like that anyway . guess we shoulda played by the rules .
somebody else makes those decisions , not guys like you and me . you've done your job , X , head back to Prague . I'll be landing in 90 minutes . this is my operation now .	we don't have that kinda time , boss , I don't think Prague's gonna be around much longer . I've gotta go now . I've got a lot of bad guys to kill .
thought you bought the farm down there , X. Glad as hell to see you .	I'm pretty happy to see me too . so are you done with me yet ?
you've kept up your end of the bargain , I'll do the same . but you really should consider staying on , you make a decent agent .	but I hate cops , remember ? except for her .
cut the crap , X , I saw you down there . you're a hero . don't be afraid to join the good guys .	who says you're the good guys ?
you know what they say , the only way to change the system is from the inside .	oh yeah ? why don't we start by taking this thing off my ankle ? the poison needles ?
on come on , X. Did you really think we were that barbaric ?	no needles , huh ? what about the acid bath ?
all for show . just a psychological mind game to get you to do the right thing .	you're a jerk-off , you know that ?
new information .	ever see one of these before ?
too important for telephone . comedian -- Dr. Manhattan . all linked up .	what is that ungodly smell ?
yeah , I've heard all about your conspiracy theories . now I've got a roomful of cameras in there . I want you out . now . and whatever you're doing , knock it off . you're making us all look bad .	fate of the world at stake , Adrian . can't get too worked up over bad press .
Gila Flats -- place where Jon turned into . . .	Dr. Manhattan , right . now if you boys care to join me , we'll go save the world .
Veidt . you're the one who started World War III .	no . I just hastened the inevitable . he's been ready to blow for years . I knew all it would take was a little push . so I , uh . . . gave his friends and associates cancer .
call off the cat and I'll kill you , Veidt .	before you do that , you might want to look at what I've been looking at .
I don't know who you are buddy , but I swear to God , you got the wrong guy .	Edgar William Jacobi , aka William Edgar Bright , a.k.a. Moloch .
you're making a big --	terrorist . radical agitator . stool pigeon .
Rorschach , you're talkin' heavy duty stuff . I got nothing to do with --	worked both sides of the fence . ask your old buddies in the CTU .
CTU ? Jesus . you don't think --	don't know . ask around . I'll be back .
two things I hate . street mimes . . . Users of recreational drugs .	no , no . you got it all wrong . I been on the case , Rorschach , I got something for you .
Adrian .	Laurie ! good to see you .
don't rub it in . I live here .	and how's life with the walking H-bomb ?
Adrian ! don't leave so soon . I --	I'll take a raincheck , Laurie .
please .	he's a little farther gone every time .
stay , Adrian . I just -- every once in a while , I need to talk to someone human . he doesn't think like we do . he doesn't even feel what we feel . I mean -- he even scares the research teams .	Laurie -- he's the most powerful man who's ever lived . he's changed the world .
I know . I shouldn't be saying this . he's happy , he's content , he's doing his work --	what about you ?
I suppose I'm serving my purpose , aren't I. I'll ring for the guards .	nasty cough . -- Try one of mine . darling , you need to get out of the house . why don't you give Daniel a call ? I'm sure he'd be glad to hear from you .
maybe I'll do that .	I'm sorry about Blake .
their real names , please .	I don't know their real names .
I don't know their real names !	"you're not "" protecting "" anyone . these people's lives may depend on the answers you give . these are all former associates of Dr. Manhattan --"
then why don't you ask him ? ! ?	sit down , Miss Juspeczyk . as I mentioned , the people in this file are all close associates of Dr. Manhattan . they have something else in common as well . they've all developed a fairly . . . exotic form of Lymphatic cancer .
what are you saying ? that Jon is radioactive ?	I'm terribly sorry .
what does this mean ? what does it --	six to eight months . that's with treatment . -- Perhaps now you can see why it's so vital that we locate your . . . friends .
all right , Miss Juspeczyk . pack your things .	am I free to go ?
you're free to do whatever you goddamn well please . let's move it .	I don't know why you've been keeping me here , but you're in deep shit --
oh , I am , honey . you see , Russian tanks are crossing the Afghan border this very minute . and we are all of us , every living soul , in deep , deep shit -- because our number-one strategic weapons has finally flipped out .	Jon ? ? you mean he's --
that's right . your meal ticket's flown the coop . that blue bastard has apparently left the planet .	Sphinx brand . when I got out of weapons design , I wanted to move into a more . . . humanitarian area . I was thinking : what would do some good in the world ? and I thought : why not a genetically-altered tobacco , that no only doesn't cause cancer -- but cleans out your lungs as you smoke it ? in fact I think I'll have one now . care to join me ?
no . no . cut . -- Justine , we agreed . no questions about the Watchmen .	oh sweetheart , just a quick one .
no comment .	did you know he was back on the streets ?
I did not . now get out of my way !	isn't it true that you --
with lots of ketchup ?	nothing wrong with ketchup .
Jon Osterman , you don't act like a Princeton boy . what's a big lug like you doing in a place like this ?	anything for science , I guess . Janey , there's something --
we should get back -- What ?	nothing . what were you going to say ?
stupid watch . stopped again . do you have the --	Janey , will you marry me ?
I can fix it .	-- What ?
Hiya , pardner . long time no see .	did anybody follow you ? see you come here ?
sure . you got some kind of -- bean juice on it .	human bean juice . the comedian is dead .
so do I. So do you .	Rorschach , that was a long time ago . I mean , that -- that's just paranoia .
maybe . or maybe somebody's finally caught up with us . somebody with a grudge . thought you might want to spread the word .	hey . hey . if you don't mind , use the back stairs , all right ?
. . . that was quick .	toilet clogged . short fat turd . let's get out of here .
I don't know if you heard . a hired gunman tried to off Adrian .	Veidt's a fool . tried to warn him about new information . Sicced his mangy cat on me .
what new information ?	Blake investigating missing scientists for CTU . Dr. Manhattan somehow involved . . .
what do you mean , frame-up ?	obvious pattern -- all ties in --
are you saying that someone would risk starting World War III just to get back at us ? what about all those poor shits with cancer ?	how do we know they've got cancer ? could be part of massive propaganda scheme . . .
come on , Rorschach . gimme a break --	where's Laurie ?
we're running , Rorschach . we've got no place to go . we're hightailing it down to Adrian's .	Veidt's assassin . leads to follow . can't just --
cases , leads -- they don't matter , Rorschach . the world's about to end . if someone is trying to kill us , it doesn't matter .	coward . giving up .
shut UP , Rorschach .	sorry , Daniel . you've always been a good friend . I know that . sorry about Laurie .
what happened ?	the guidance system's fried . I had to switch to manual . -- Some kind of massive electromagnetic shockwave .
what caused it ?	don't know . nothing I can think of -- -- outside of a nuclear blast .
Adrian . what are you doing ? why wouldn't you let us in ?	he's the one . he's been the one all along . stalking us .
Adrian -- you ? you killed Blake , and --	. . . and they call me a fucking nut .
sorry , it's this thing with Blake . I mean , you don't really think anyone's out to get us -- do you ?	Dan , are you really that paranoid ? let's face it , Eddie Blake was no Mother Teresa .
psychotic pig . he had it coming . Mr. CTU . . .	now wait . we all had the same option as Blake . it was work for the government or do time .
okay , okay . you made your choice . you went underground . some of us made other choices .	
damn straight .	damn straight ! we were heroes .
of course , we looked like idiots in those bondage outfits .	well , that was Adrian's idea . I know he's the smartest man in the world and all that , but -- talk about publicity Hounds . . .
oh yeah . the one that used to confess to everything ? hoping we'd beat him up ?	that's the one . whatever happened to him ?
oh , yeah . they gave me a clean bill of health and then booted me the hell out . no expense account . no place to live .	you'll find something . -- I should go . you and me , seeing each other , someone might put two and two together . . .
they're not following me , Dan . I mean -- Jon's gone , we're right on the brink of World War III . nobody cares about the Watchmen .	maybe not , but why take chances ?
oh . no . sorry . I'll be right down the hall if you want me . . . I mean , if you need some aspirin , or --	I'm gonna take a warm bath and sack out . -- You've been really sweet . sleep tight , okay ?
his what ?	his . . . whatever .
I told you I was a little bit out of step . a lot of the old stuff I listen to -- it never came out on crystal .	I'd say you stalled out about forty years ago . Nellie Lutcher -- Louis Jordan -- I've never even heard of these people .
no wonder Adrian's rich . you use that stuff ?	sure . it works . I mean , look at this face , Daniel . I'm thirty-eight years old !
I don't mind getting older . I'm obsolete anyway . why try to hide it ?	I like the way you look . it's strange with Jon . he doesn't age . his face doesn't change . but you , Daniel , you look . . .
old ?	not at all . you look very -- dashing . here , you pick one .
. . . what ?	pick a record . I feel like dancing .
eight cops ? oh , great . a jury's gonna love that .	are you kidding ? if they put him in jail he's dead . he'll never get to trial .
I just realized . I'd never seen his face . I guess it was just a matter of time . he's totally -- Daniel ? what's wrong ?	the comedian . . . Jon . . . now Rorschach .
Ohh . I could use some dinner . who was that on the phone ?	one more down . someone tried to kill Adrian . . . . first time I've ever heard him scared .
-- What is it .	I know what you're thinking . you'd be a lot safer if I weren't around .
Laurie --	I'm an open target , Dan . if you're with me --
enough is enough , Daniel . where exactly are we ?	memory lane .
the Owlship . I can't believe it .	-- I thought it was time for a routine maintenance check .
I took her out a couple of summers back . scared the hell out of some cows . -- I wonder if she'd make it down to Antarctica .	Antarctica ? ?
would you want to sit out a war ? I mean -- what would be left .	you and me .
Dan ! the spare costumes ! I can't believe you kept them .	me neither . mine barely even fits . the thing is , I try to remember why we did it , and I can't . helping people , or righting wrongs , or trying to save the world . . . I don't know . it all seems so abstract .
God , you sound like Jon . -- Turn around .	what are you up to ?
don't look . turn around .	this'd better not be what I think it is .
okay !	what the hell -- ?
it's a peace rally . the CTU's just opened fire on the crowd .	oh , Laurie . Jesus . no .
they're following us .	all right . mission accomplished .
missed' em Dan . you're aiming high !	I don't want to take' em out . just want to keep' em interested .
they're practically on us . . .	that Detroit shit ? I'm so worried .
what ?	the costumes . am I right ?
no way . I'm not that much of a pervert .	yes you are .
no offense , Laurie , but it was Silk Spectre I had the crush on . tonight was the first time I've felt like myself in ten years .	that's because --
it's because there's nothing to be afraid of anymore . the world's about to end . I feel like I could save it .	you're full of yourself . what are you doing ?
long as we're on the subject of perverts . . . I miss Rorschach . let's spring him .	. . . what ? ?
what's he doing ?	I think he's going to the john .
I beg your pardon . . . ? some gratitude .	will you two lovebirds keep it down ?
welcome back , Night Owl .	what now ? fly south -- hook up with Adrian ?
what was he doing ?	trying to change the past . he said it was the only way to save the world --
he saved himself . he changed the past .	where did he go ?
those cars . what year is this ? ?	everything's changed --
Dan -- what do we do now ?	wherever we are , it's better than what we left . backs together --
the comedian . he's dead . murdered . that's all I know .	my God . murdered ? -- What's this have to do with Rorschach ?
it's -- he's got some kind of conspiracy theory . he thinks someone's . . . I don't know , stalking us .	us . you mean the Watchmen .
I know , I know , it's just -- he's back on the street , he smells blood .	you know how he is . he goes on these binges , kills a couple of thugs -- then he's satisfied . it blows over .
if he comes here , I'll handle him . remember -- I've always protected you . haven't I ? do you need money ?	no . I just wanted you to --
you did the right thing , Daniel . let's stay in touch , okay ? good night .	good night .
I don't know , but . . . in the wake of all that's happened , I'm starting to think Rorschach may have been right . is Laurie okay ?	she's with me .
good . be careful , Daniel , don't let up your guard . look , I'm going to head south for a while -- hole up at Karnak until all this blows over . you two would be welcome to join me .	thanks for the offer , Adrian . I'll let you know .
the missing scientists .	uh huh . you might recognize the names . quite a few of them worked at Gila Flats .
what ? ?	I couldn't let him interfere with my project .
it is Jon . twenty-four years ago . before he turned into Dr. Manhattan .	good Lord . how'd you get it on tape ?
gentlemen , the past . unfolding before your eyes . stand back from the field . it'll blow you to bits .	what is it ? how does it work ?
it's a tachyon chamber . it generates subatomic particles which flow backward in time . there are other worlds , Daniel , other timelines -- existing parallel to our own --	Adrian -- you've lost it .
and what if you ¹ re wrong ?	I ¹ m not .
what if you ¹ re wrong ? ?	then I ¹ ve been a very bad boy and you ¹ ll have to spank me . Christ ! I ¹ m doing what I have to do to save the godforsaken human race ! !
your problem , Dan , is a lack of vision . you spent all those years chasing after muggers , and drug dealers , and jaywalkers . . . as if the world was any better for it . as if any of it mattered .	you ruthless son of a bitch . you really believe this mad-scientist bullshit is going to save the world ?
Blake ? dead ?	yes . I heard this morning . Washington's asked me to attend the funeral as a matter of protocol .
I'm here , Laurie .	is it time ? d'you have to leave for the funeral ?
would you like me to stay ?	Mm hmm .
I could stay and go .	. . . and just how would you manage that ?
I'm not here . I'm still on Mars . I've come to collect you .	collect me ?
Jon , no -- I can't --	it will happen , Laurie . I've already seen it . neither of us can do anything to change it .
the atmosphere . I'm sorry . these things slip my mind .	Jesus , Jon , I nearly choked to -- where are we --
this whole place is ticking . does it -- keep time ?	yes . in about . . . thirty seconds , for example , you'll tell me you're sleeping with Dreiberg .
Jon , does anybody know what the hell you're talking about ? Dan's just an ordinary guy , but he talks to me . when he looks at me he's seeing something more than just a -- a collection of atoms .	then you're sleeping with Dreiberg ?
well , I just , you just said -- don't act surprised .	that's how time works , Laurie . everything is preordained . . . even my responses . we're all puppets . I'm just a puppet who can see the strings . -- thirty seconds .
yes , I loved you . I left the earth when I lost you .	yet you must've known all along that you'd give me cancer . just be being with me .
I didn't give you cancer , Laurie . not you , not the others . I don't know what did .	but you knew that I'd -- die .
memories of the future are just like any others . I've tried not to dwell on the unpleasant ones . . . you won't die of cancer , Laurie . there won't be time for that .	then it's going to happen . the world's going to end . -- And you've always known .
always . ever since the day I died .	then why don't you . . . do something about it !
because --	"because you can't , I know , it's preordained . so sorry . I forgot . Jon . this , this "" script "" you're following . . . who writes it ?"
I don't know yet . I should be able to tell you in -- roughly six hundred years .	I can't stand any more of this . I want to go back . if I'm going to die I want to be with -- other people .
please , Laurie . not yet . I've got eons stretching before me , a universe to explore . I'll be alone . you're the last human being I'll ever see .	Jon , I do not want to hear it .
I'm sorry . look -- there's a gas storm on the Valles Marineris . . .	oh God . I'm no more than a bug on a windshield to you .
you're the only human being I care for .	then do me a favor . if the world's going to end , it shouldn't matter a bit . I want you to cure me .
I won't do that .	you have the power to do it . I want you to do it . please .
I explained this . I can't . that's not the way it happens .	Jon . if you ever loved me -- if there's anything human left in you -- then do it .
what -- am I --	cured , yes .
it ¹ s very strange . time ¹ s flowing backwards . . .	Jon -- what ? ?
Jon , where are we ?	Veidt ¹ s complex .
Jon --	space and time . I finally understand , Laurie . I see it all now .
Jon -- for God ¹ s sake , what do you see ?	I see what the watchmaker made . I see the universe !
hi , Jon .	hello , Adrian .
the bearer of bad news .	we've lost a colleague . the comedian is dead .
"Rorschach's on the case . he's got Dreiberg in a lather . he seems to think that someone is "" stalking "" the Watchmen ."	oh ? the CTU suspects a Libyan hit squad .
what's your theory ?	life and death are unquantifiable abstracts . they don't concern me .
I guess you'll be dismantling Russian tanks soon .	you mean Afghanistan ? it won't require my attention . what I'm doing here is far more interesting .
what ARE YOU DOING , VEIDT ?	Jon ! get back ! you don't understand .
Walter --	don't call me that .
Walter -- you're just telling me what you think I want to hear .	wrong answers ?
there's no right or wrong . but if you don't give me an honest response , I can't help you . I want to help you . I want to know all about you .	Hnnrr . -- Like to masturbate . shit once a day .
a whore fucking .	who is she ? do you know her ?
and what -- split -- the dog's skull open ?	why , doctor . I did . he was a bad dog .
Walter . this compulsion of yours -- to punish transgressors . in your mind . . . what gives you the right to judge ?	God isn't there to do it .
that man , then , he was the first . the first you --	saw the world that night -- random , empty , hideous . God didn't make it that way . we did . we make the world -- in our own image . what else can I illuminate ?
had a lot of blood in him .	you oughta see upstairs . it's a slaughterhouse .
small army , from the looks of it . he put up one hell of a fight .	he would -- You might as well know . it's gonna get messy . we got a call from Washington .
Washington ?	they want in . seems our friend here was hardcore CTU .
what about our end ?	well , sir . . . in a worst-case scenario . . . we'd assume that twenty-five percent of the Russian birds get through .
what kind of time frame are we talking about ?	thirty minutes maximum . of course , I assume we'd be in the fortified command bunker at the time of the launch order .
as you can see , we may be able to salvage a good-sized chunk of the farm belt .	"what about the aftermath ? this so-called . . . "" nuclear winter "" theory ?"
we don't really know , sir , but bluntly , our survival capability . . . may depend on a quirk of the weather .	the weather . I see . keep me posted . I want hourly forecasts and a full report on optimum strike conditions .
Major Adamson , I can't seem to get in the door .	Laurie , I'll have to ask you to come with me .
why ? what's the problem ?	I can't tell you that . it is quite urgent .
I would like to use the bathroom --	the access code's been changed . your card won't work anymore .
what ? !	please .
we ’ ve been pawns in someone ’ s game . they tricked us into bringing the money to King . not just elaborate . Cock-sure .	and expensive . cost three million plus .
do we have the range of Renard ’ s plane ?	anywhere in this circle . Iran , Iraq , Pakistan , Syria , Afghanistan ...
it ’ s heading for the oil terminal .	where it can do the most damage .
any word from him ?	still no contact yet .
warm .	is it ?
so beautiful . so smooth , so warm .	how would you know ?
why are you like this ? because Bond is dead ? it ’ s what you wanted .	of course ...
he was a ... good lover ?	what do you think ?
this is the end .	no . it is the beginning . the world will never be the same .
everything ’ s under control up here . are you ready ?	yes . au revoir ...
perhaps this isn ’ t the time ...	please .
your father ...	is nothing . his kingdom he stole from my mother . the kingdom I will rightly take back .
now you know how it feels . to be locked away , to wonder if they ’ re coming for you , if anyone will ever come for you .	someone will come .
what ?	to haul some cargo . my nephew , he is Captain of a sub in the Black Sea Fleet .
no ! bond !	bond !
what is this place ?	former KGB surveillance post . the dye Factory was just a front ; now it turns a good profit .
in the good old days , the KGB had three or four spots where our submarines could surface without anyone knowing . but Yevgeny is supposed to be loading cargo .	what class sub does your nephew run ?
Valentin Zukovsky .	BondJamesBond . what brings you here ?
you , of course . I need some information .	bond , I ’ m a civilian . this is my place . used to be the royal family ’ s , now it ’ s mine . I run my little business , I stay out of trouble ...
Mafia warlords , Diplomats and spies , consortiums from every country in the world . a nice little rat ’ s nest .	have some of the rat ’ s nest caviar . from my own fishery . they buy my caviar , drink my champagne , lose to my House .
see ? you ’ re upsetting my customers . what do you want ?	how does a terrorist like Renard supply his men with state-of-the-art Russian Army weapons ?
what ? this is not possible .	if I remember my Cyrillic that says 101st airborne division .
where did you get this ?	off a high-powered Paraski that was trying to kill me .
that too . everyone does what they can to survive .	how high up does this ... arms dealing go ?
bond . if someone wants you dead , it is Renard . our government has nothing to gain by killing you .	but you would have something to gain by killing Robert King . and stopping his pipeline .
she ’ s no innocent . this is my nuclear consultant .	ah , I see . a purely ... plutonic relationship .
really Bond , couldn ’ t you find a nice Russian scientist with hair growing out of his ears ?	what ’ s your business with Elektra King ?
I thought you were the one in her business .	she dropped a million and half dollars to the House -- your House . and you didn ’ t even bat an eyelid . she was paying you off . what for ?
now ... where were we ?	a rope !
alright , alright ! sometimes I smuggle machinery for her . Russian stuff .	and the payoff on the tables ?
where ’ s the sub going ? !	no ! get me out !
this is too big for even you . where is it ?	this is a family matter ! if my nephew is in danger , we do it my way , or nothing ! now get me out !
so . my way . no MI-6 , no Interpol . just you , me and my people .	where ?
mother of God .	the right kind of explosion in the right spot -- it would block the Bosphorus , cut off the Black Sea .
how appropriate .	I ’ d heard there were some renovations there ... no one would look for a sub in that place in a million years .
I met you at my father ’ s funeral .	yes .
funerals aren ’ t exactly memorable .	God no . all those horrible loved ones and relatives . I don ’ t want to talk to those people . I just want to ... talk to my father . I loved him . I ’ m not sure he knew that .
is that why you want to finish the pipeline ?	partially , yes .
who is he ?	my bodyguard . he follows me everywhere . he ’ s decisive , vigilant . and he makes an excellent omelette .
how long has he been with you ?	since the kidnapping . why do you ask ?
does this look familiar to you ?	it ’ s my father ’ s pin . he wore it everyday of his life .
are you trying to break my heart ? or is it just your way with women ?	it ’ s not the pin your father wore . it ’ s an exact duplicate . inside is a tiny electrical detonator . we have reason to believe the assassin had an inside accomplice , someone who worked at this company .
if you ’ ve come here to look after me , Mr. Bond , thank you , but no thank you . I have two bodyguards , I don ’ t need a third ...	the killer doesn ’ t want to see this pipeline continue , doesn ’ t want to see you take over ...
that ’ s every man within a five mile radius . including you . that ’ s why you ’ re here , isn ’ t it ? you think I can ’ t do it . you think I ’ m going to screw up . or get myself killed .	I think running this pipeline would be a difficult job for anyone . especially King ’ s daughter .
I have to check the upper lines . Gabor will drive you back .	always wanted to see the upper lines .
you don ’ t take no for an answer , do you ?	no .
oh my God ... we ’ re buried alive ...	we ’ re alright .
I can ’ t stay here .	you ’ re not going to .
no ! it will cave in !	it ’ s the only way out ...
I can ’ t stay .	I know .
the way I acted , in the snow ... you must think I ’ m a coward .	I think you ’ re one of the Bravest people I ’ ve ever met .
what is it ?	... you should rest .
I have to go .	then take me with you .
no . you ’ ll be safe here .	I don ’ t want to be safe !
vodka martini .	two . shaken not stirred .
what the hell are you doing here ?	someone wants to kill me , I ’ d rather die looking him straight in the eye . what are you doing here ? looking for a woman a little more your type ? how about that one ?
if this little show is for my benefit , I ’ ll take you home right now .	you had your chance , James . now I ’ m looking for a bigger thrill .
I understand it ’ s normally good practice to get the feel of the cards before going off the deep end .	really ?
surely you believe in living dangerously .	not at that price . time to surrender .
you knew when you first saw me . you knew it would be like this .	shush .
how did you survive ?	I used my body on the guards . it gave me control . I got to a gun and I took my chance . I ’ ve never told anyone that .
what ’ s wrong with you ? are you crazy ?	a little . does it matter ? after all , what ’ s the point of living if you can ’ t feel alive ? isn ’ t that right , Elektra ? isn ’ t that your motto ?
what are you talking about ?	or did you steal it from your old friend Renard ?
... what ?	we had a run-in , he and I. He knew about us , he knew about my shoulder , he knew exactly where to hurt me ...
are you saying ... Renard is the man who ’ s trying to kill me ?	you can drop the act , it ’ s over .
I don ’ t know what you ’ re talking about !	I think you do .
how dare you ! how dare you ! that animal ! ? that monster ! ? he disgusts me ! you disgust me ! so he knew where to hurt you , is that it ? you had a sling on your arm at the funeral ! I didn ’ t have to sleep with you to find that out .	he used your exact words .
I ’ m coming with you .	you do what you have to do , but I ’ ve called in M. She ’ s en route from London even now .
I could have given you the world .	not interested .
where ’ s M ?	soon she ’ ll be everywhere .
all this , because you fell for Renard ?	five more turns and your neck will break .
since I was a child , I ’ ve always had a power over men . when I realized my father wouldn ’ t rescue me from the kidnappers , I knew I had to form a new alliance .	you turned Renard .
so you killed your father .	he killed me ! he killed me the day he refused to pay my ransom .
was this all about the oil ?	it is my oil ! mine and my family ’ s !
it runs in my veins , thicker than blood . I ’ m going to redraw the map . and when I am through the whole world will know my name , my grandfather ’ s name , the glory of my people .	no-one will believe this melt-down was an accident .
one ... last ... screw ?	oh James .
beautiful , isn ’ t it ?	yes .
today , of all days , the sun decides to shine .	perhaps Sir Robert had a word with the Man Upstairs .
a word ? I ’ m sure by now he ’ s engineered a hostile takeover .	you knew him well ?
he was my father .	I ’ m sorry .
I see my friend Davidov ran into some difficulty .	indeed .
revenge isn ’ t so hard to fathom . what ’ s clever is getting someone else to pay for it .	not many people in this world have that kind of fortune .
who is it ?	you think I fear death ? I welcome it . I get on my knees and pray for it . you , on the other hand , you have something to live for , no ? she ’ s beautiful isn ’ t she ? you should have seen her before . Flawless , and still so innocent , not such a whore in bed ...
you will never touch her . you will never get near her .	have you forgotten who saved your life in Geneva ?
consider me ungrateful .	it ’ s I who should thank you -- for taking that money back to MI-6 . so distressing for M. An explosion inside her lair .
she ’ ll get over it .	you even brought the plane for us . we really couldn ’ t have done it without you .
in case you ’ ve forgotten . I ’ m dead already .	haven ’ t you heard the news ? so is she .
not the usual Swiss procedure , Mr. Bond , but you understand , a man in my position ..	which is neutral , no doubt .
I did not get the report from an MI-6 agent .	who did you get it from ?
I am just a middle man . I am doing the honourable thing and returning the money to its rightful owner ...	and we know how difficult that can be for the Swiss .
your last chance . take the money .	your last chance . give me the name .
the name ?	I can ’ t tell you ... Alright , alright ! but you must protect me !
construction ’ s not exactly my line .	quite the opposite , in fact .
old friend ?	since Oxford . I knew him when he had nothing but a brilliant mind and enough guts to conquer the world . he ’ s a man of great integrity .
she ’ s not a girl anymore .	I ’ ve scheduled a medical for you .
it ’ s barely a scratch . the Dome broke my fall .	well , at least it turned out to have some purpose .
007 . what do you know of the Caspian Sea ?	caviar capital of the world . Matchless Beluga . firm , yet subtle . largest landlocked body of water on Earth . Oil-rich . Hitler wanted it . Stalin beat him to it .
who told you to look at Elektra ’ s files ?	I took the initiative .
I was the one who brought that money in ...	I ’ m well aware of your stake in this , 007 . if you have a point , get to it .
it ’ s a message . he wants us to know he ’ s back .	who ?
Claude Serrault . A.K.A ...	Renard .
sir Robert tried to deal with the kidnapping with his own ... resources , at first . when Elektra ’ s ear was delivered to him in the post , he came to me . I advised against paying the ransom . I knew it was Renard . I played it out as long as possible to get a fix on him .	sacrifice the girl to take out the terrorist ?
he survived ?	the doctor who saved him couldn ’ t get it out , so Renard killed him . when Interpol found the X-rays , there was mild jubilation . Effectively , he ’ s a dead man .
the bullet is moving through the medulla oblongata , killing off his sense of touch . he feels no pain . he can push himself harder , longer than any normal man .	‘ That which does not kill me makes me stronger . ’
now Robert is dead . he got his revenge .	he ’ s not through yet . Renard doesn ’ t blow up five million dollars unless he knows there ’ s more coming in . he ’ s working for someone . someone who wants to stop the pipeline . and they hired the perfect killer . one with a vendetta against King ... and you .
get out to the pipeline . find the insider who switched the pin . if your instincts are right , Renard will be back . he hasn ’ t completed the job . the pipeline is still going forward , and we have Elektra to thank for that .	the worm on the hook again .
the report King bought . it ’ s a manual . Renard ’ s men used it to remove this radio tracking device from the warhead .	then Robert was right about a Russian connection .
the inside man ?	is maybe ... the inside woman .
dislocated collar bone . if any more tendons snap ... It won ’ t just be two weeks out of action .	I need you to pass me fit now , Molly .
it ’ s just a scratch .	James . it wouldn ’ t really be ...
then maybe I ’ d be ... open to that .	perhaps after this ... test ?
... yes ? ...	I could come for a second opinion ?
you new ?	yes . Viktor Davidov , Miss ... ?
doctor . Jones . Christmas Jones . no jokes , I ’ ve heard them all .	don ’ t know any doctor jokes .
what happened to Len Tashka ?	couldn ’ t make it . splitting headache .
he is an impostor . there ’ s no Davidov at Miratom .	here ’ s your imposter . he ’ s paid off the men on the plane outside . they ’ re not taking the bomb to any Russian facility , they ’ re flying it wherever he tells them .
shame you had to spot I wasn ’ t the real thing .	so who are you ?
when this is over we should bury the hatchet . celebrate . a champagne dinner ?	when this is over our bodies may be blown to smithereens .
the plutonium is missing . they ’ ve taken the core !	then it ’ s no longer a bomb ?
what the hell were you doing ? you nearly killed us !	I did kill us . she thinks we ’ re dead . and she thinks she got away with it .
what the hell are you talking about ?	it ’ s part of some plan . she dresses it up like a terrorist attack . the explosion covers up the theft of the plutonium .
who ’ s she ?	Elektra King .
Elektra King ? are you insane ? this is her pipeline .	makes her look even more innocent .
what would she want with weapons grade plutonium ?	I was hoping you could tell me .
what is it ?	she just upped the stakes . all her chips are on the table now . and M ’ s life is part of the bet .
nuclear .	not just nuclear . powered by a nuclear reactor . he ’ s not loading any cargo . they want the sub . the sub itself . put weapons grade plutonium inside the sub ’ s reactor : instant , catastrophic meltdown .
but why ? eight million people would die , the land irradiated for a hundred years . a cloud of radiation the size of Europe ...	because an explosion like that would kill all the other pipelines . there would be only one way to get the oil out of the Caspian and pump it to the world ...
the King pipeline .	Elektra would control it all .
Zukovsky ...	if I don ’ t get to the Boa before he gets to Maiden ’ s Tower , M is dead .
is there another way ?	we go down to the torpedo bay .
he ’ s sealed himself in .	he ’ s going to insert the plutonium .
do you know what you ’ re doing ?	like riding a bike .
what kind of bikes did you ride ?	just wanted to put him on edge ...
count to twenty . when you get to twenty open the hatch . it can only be opened for a few seconds or we ’ ll sink .	but what if ...
I love Christmas in Turkey .	so isn ’ t it time you unwrapped your present ?
as for you , my galvanized friend , you want a heart ! you don't know how lucky you are not to have one . hearts will never be practical until they can be made unbreakable . I could have been a world figure , a power among men , a - a successful wizard , had I not been obstructed by a heart .	but I still want one .
stop that dog !	this is a highly irregular procedure ! this is absolutely unprecedented !
oh ! help me ! the balloon's going up !	-- ruined my exit !
help !	uh - now , please don't be angry with me . I'll - I'll do anything you say , only ... only if you don't shout at me . it makes me nervous !
it makes you nervous ?	yes .
what about us ?	well , I --
what about the heart that you promised Tin Man -- ?	well , I --
-- And the courage that you promised cowardly Lion ?	well , I --
well --	you promised us real things -- a real ...
therefore , by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Universitatus Committeeatum e plurbis unum , I hereby confer upon you the honorary degree of Th.D.	Th.D. ?
how can I ever thank you enough ?	well , you can't . as for you , my fine friend -- you're a victim of disorganized thinking . you are under the unfortunate delusion that simply because you run away from danger , you have no courage . you're confusing courage with wisdom . back where I come from , we have men who are called heroes . once a year , they take their fortitude out of mothballs and parade it down the main street of the city . and they have no more courage than you have . but ! they have one thing that you haven't got ! a medal ! therefore -- for meritorious ....
beautiful ! what an echo !	it's empty . the tinsmith forgot to give me a heart .
I'm not afraid of her . I'll see you get safely to the Wizard now , whether I get a brain or not ! stuff a mattress with me ! hah !	I'll see you reach the Wizard , whether I get a heart of not . Bee-hive -- bah ! let her try and make a bee-hive out of me ! you know -- hmm ? what's that ?
no , sir !	no , sir !
that's right .	we do .
to Oz ?	to Oz !
animals that -- that eat straw ?	some -- but mostly lions , and tigers , and bears .

help ! help ! help ! help ! help !	oh ! well , what happened to you ?
they tore my legs off , and they threw them over there ! then they took my chest out , and they threw it over there !	well , that's you all over .
who do you suppose they were ? and where did they take her ? a fine thing - to go to pieces at a time like this !	now , now , don't fret .
oh , dear , dear .	we'll get you together !
... to Dorothy !	oh --
oh , I hate to think of her in there . we've got to get her out .	don't cry now . we haven't got the oil-can with us and you've been squeaking enough as it is .
no , you don't .	oh , no !
Whew ! that wasn't my plan - but something happened , didn't it ?	you put up a great fight , Lion .
yeah --	I don't know what we'd have done without you .
oh - upstairs , quickly !	go on !
hey -- what about Dorothy ?	yes -- how about Dorothy ?
... junk !	Ohhhh -- yes ... yes , sir -- Y-Yes , your Honor . you see , a while back , we were walking down the Yellow brick Road , and --
quiet !	Ohhhhhh !
... of the West .	B-B-B-B-B-But if we do that , we'll have to kill her to get it !
Mr. Gale !	Howdy , Miss Gulch .
... about Dorothy .	Dorothy ? well , what has Dorothy done ?
what's she done ? I'm all but lame from the bite on my leg !	you mean she bit you ?
no , her dog !	oh , she bit her dog , eh ?
sneaking up on me , eh ? why !	here -- here . go' way and let us alone !
I haven't slept in weeks .	why don't you try counting sheep ?
not even a rhinoceros ?	Imposserous !
from now on , we're on enemy ground . you should have something to protect yourself with .	she - she can have my Witch Remover .
what's that ? what's that ? take it away - take it away - Take it away !	hold still - hold still --
it's a whatzis ?	Whozat ?

where do we go now ?	yeah .
you don't get around us that easy !	not nohow !
comin' to think of it , forty winks wouldn't be bad .	don't you start it , too !
what if it were a brontosaurus ?	I'd show him who was King of the Fores' !
would ... would it do any good if I roared ?	who at ?
wait a minute , fellahs . I was just thinkin' . I really don't want to see the Wizard this much . I better wait for you outside .	what's the matter ?

real courage . that's what we want .	you do ? boys , you're aiming low . you not only surprise , but you grieve me .
yeah .	ah --

... excellence to the Miracle Wonderland Carnival Company -- until one day , while performing spectacular feats of stratospheric skill never before attempted by civilized man , an unfortunate phenomena occurred . the balloon failed to return to the fair .	it did ?
who killed my sister ? who killed the Witch of the East ? was it you ? answer me !	leave her alone !
... ting the Ruby slippers ?	the slippers -- yes ..... the slippers !
the Ruby slippers ! what have you done with them ? give them back to me , or I'll ---	it's too late ! there they ....
you stay out of this , Glinda , or I'll fix you as well !	oh , rubbish ! you have no power here . be gone , before somebody drops a house on you , too .
... don't talk .	it's pleasant down that way , too .
down ? no , you see , I'm -- Well , -- I'm --	oh , well , here -- let me help you .
... yes .	Ohhhh --
Ohh !	Whhhooops ! Ha-ha -- there goes some of me again !
oh -- does it hurt you ?	oh , no -- I just keep picking it up and putting it back in again .
Ohhh --	my , it's good to be ....
... free !	oh ! oh ! Ohhh !
did I scare you ?	no , No -- I -- I just thought you hurt yourself .
wonderful ! why , if our Scarecrow back in Kansas could do that , the crows'd be scared to pieces !	they would ?
where's Kansas ?	that's where I live . and I want to get back there so badly I'm going all the way to Emerald City to get the Wizard of Oz to help me .
you're going to see a Wizard ?	Um-hmm .
do you think if I went with you this Wizard would give me some brains ?	I couldn't say . but even if he didn't , you'd be no worse off than you are now .
yes -- that's true .	but maybe you'd better not . I've got a witch mad at me , and you might get into trouble .
witch ? huh ! I'm not afraid of a witch ! I'm not afraid of anything --- except a lighted match .	I don't blame you for that .
Hooray ! we're off to see a Wizard !	oh -- well -- you're not starting out very well .
oh , I'll try ! really , I will .	to Oz ?
oh , dear -- I keep forgetting I'm not in Kansas .	come along , Dorothy -- you don't want any of those apples . hmm !
Hooray ! I guess that did it ! help yourself .	oh --
why , it's a man ! a man made out of tin !	what ?
oil can what ?	oil can ? oh -- oh , here it is !
he said his mouth .	here -- here --
... just that the Witch is so wicked . I don't think you two ought to come with me because you'll get into trouble .	oh , you don't think we're going to stand by and let her get away with fireballs and bees , do you ?
oh , you're the best friends anybody ever had ! and it's funny , but I feel as if I've known you all the time . but I couldn't have , could I ?	I don't see how . you weren't around when I was stuffed and sewn together , were you ?
I don't like this forest ! it's -- it's dark and creepy !	of course , I don't know , but I think it'll get darker before it gets lighter .
oh , that's too bad . don't you think the Wizard could help him , too ?	I don't see why not . why don't you come along with us ? we're on our way to see the Wizard now . to get him a heart .
... along .	oh , no -- please . I have to rest for just a minute . Toto !
it does help . Dorothy , you're waking up !	oh --
yes -- there --	oh -- here quick -- oh ! - we'll oil him up .
-- A hot water bottle would be good if we had one .	oh , he's been crying ! why have you been --
dear , whatever shall we do ?	well , we'd better hurry if we're going to see the Wizard !
oh --	looks like we came a long way for nothing .
oh , come on now - everybody --	did you just hear what I just heard ?
no -- No -- No -- No !	Ohh ! OHH ! OHH !
now lookit , Dorothy , you ain't using your head about Miss Gulch . think you didn't have any brains at all .	I have so got brains .
well , why don't you use them ? when you come home , don't go by Miss Gulch's place . then Toto won't get in her garden , and you won't get in no trouble . see ?	oh , hunk , you just won't listen , that's all .
why , Zeke , -- you're just as scared as I am !	what's the matter -- gonna let a little old pig make a coward out of you ?
what -- what did you do that for ? I didn't bite him .	no , but you tried to .
it's bad enough picking on a straw man , but when you go around picking on poor little dogs --	well , you didn't have to go and hit me , did you ? is my nose bleeding ?
well , of course not . my goodness , what a fuss you're making . well , naturally , when you go around picking on things weaker than you are -- Why , you're nothing but a great big coward !	you're right -- I am a coward .
... has been simply unbearable .	oh .
a home --	the nerve .
it's beautiful , isn't it ? just like I knew it would be . he really must be a wonderful Wizard to live in a City like that !	well , come on , then . what are we waiting for ?
yes -- let's run !	yes .
oh -- unusual weather we're having , ain't it ?	look ! he's rusted again . oh , give me the oil can -- quick ! Oh-oh , quick !
ho -- ho --ho -- ho	hah !
I'll be home in time for supper !	in another hour , I'll be King of the Forest . long Live the King ! if ....
your Majesty , if you were king You wouldn't be afraid of anything ?	not nobody , not nohow !
how about a hippopotamus ?	why , I'd thrash him from top to bottomamus !
Supposin' you met an elephant ?	I'd wrap him up in cellophant !
I'd be too scared to ask him for it .	oh , well , then -- we'll ask him for you .
I'd sooner wait outside .	but why ? why ?
because I'm still scared !	oh , come on .
oh -- Oh , come on .	huh ? what'd he say ?
does it work ?	no , but it's wonderful for threatening with .
oh --	that noise don't come from no ordinary bird .
as Monarch of the Forest I don't like the situation .	are you gonna stand around And let' em fill us full of horror ?
I'd like to roar' em down -- But I think I lost my roarer .	oh -- Oh -- Oh ! Toto -- Toto !
did they hurtcha ?	lion , darling -- I knew you'd come !
they're coming back !	Ohhh !
... Ain't it the truth ! ain't it the truth !	oh -- oh -- they're all wonderful .
oh , now I'll never get home !	stay with us , then , Dorothy . we all love you . we don't want you to go .
oh , that's very kind of you -- but this could never be like Kansas . Auntie Em must have stopped wondering what happened to me by now . oh , Scarecrow , what am I going to do ?	well -- I would never've found it if it hadn't been for you .
oh , my !	lions and tigers and bears !
oh , my !	lions and tigers and bears !
oh , my !	lions and tigers and bears !
oh , my !	lions and tigers and bears !

well , you're perfect now .	my ... my neck . my ... my neck . perfect ? oh -- bang on my chest if you think I'm perfect . go ahead -- bang on it !
oh --	all hollow . oh --
oh , oh , oh , oh , oh , oh , oh , are you all right ?	I'm afraid I'm a little rusty yet .
oh , dear -- That was wonderful ! you know -- we were just wondering why you couldn't come to Emerald City with us to ask the Wizard of Oz for a heart .	Emerald City ? why , that's a long and dangerous journey . and it might rain on the way .
well , suppose the Wizard wouldn't get me one when we got there ?	oh , but he will ! he must ! we've come such a long way already .
oh , goodness ! did any of them sting you ?	I - I guess they tried to , but they bent their stingers .
oh , dear . I don't know what I'd do if a whole swarm kept -- Oh ! oh ! oh , there's one on me !	oh - I'll get it !
oh , see - I killed it . oh , I killed that poor little honey bee !	Oh-oh-
and I was standing over there rusting for the longest time .	still , I wish I could remember . but , I guess it doesn't matter anyway . we know each other now , don't we ?
we might .	oh --
and bears !	what sort of an animal is that ?
and him a brain .	I'm sure he could give you some courage .
can't that female take no for an answer ?	oh --
no . why only -- Oh --	oh ! oh , Tin Man ! oh !
oh ! something bit me , too !	now come on - you're acting silly --
Dorothy !	I knew you would !
tomorrow ? oh , but I want to go home now .	you've had plenty of time already !
ahh --- Oh , it ticks ! listen !	yes ... !
... yes .	look -- it ticks !
now I know I've got a heart --' cause it's breaking .	oh -- Goodbye , Lion . you know , I know it isn't right , but I'm going to miss the way you used to holler for help before you found your courage .
that dog's a menace to the community . I'm taking him to the sheriff and make sure he's destroyed .	destroyed ? Toto ? oh , you can't ! you mustn't ! Auntie Em ! Uncle Henry ! you won't let her , will you ?
now you're seeing reason .	no --
here's what I'm taking him in -- so he can't attack me again .	oh , no , no ! I won't let you take him ! you go away , you .... ! Oooh , I'll bite you myself !
here ! I've got an order ! let me have ...	stop her !
let's see -- you're -- you're travelling in disguise . no , that's not right . I -- you're -- you're going on a visit . no , I'm wrong . that's ... You're -- running away .	how did you guess ?
Professor marvel never guesses -- he knows ! now , why are you running away ?	why --
no , no -- now don't tell me . they -- they don't understand you at home . they don't appreciate you . you want to see other lands -- big cities -- big mountains -- big oceans --	why , it's just like you could read what was inside of me .
yes --	please , Professor , why can't we go along with you ?
oh , yes - you - you wanted to go home , huh ?	oh , no , I wanted to go along with you .
oh --	nobody cares about me at home . they wouldn't even miss me .
aw , come , come , come --	no , they won't - honestly .
oh --	Auntie Em was even going to let them kill Toto yesterday for biting Miss Gulch . oh , please , Professor , why can't we go with you and see all the crowned Heads of Europe ?
that's our farm !	oh -- yes .
... her face is careworn .	yes ... That's Aunt Em .
her -- her name is Emily .	that's right . what's she doing ?
well , I -- I can't quite see . why , she's crying .	oh --
someone has hurt her -- someone has just about broken her heart .	me ?
Uh-huh .	what's she doing now ?
... room --	has it poppies on the wall ....
... paper ?	I said it had poppies on the wall paper ! eh -- she's -- What's this ? why , she's -- she's putting her hand on her heart -- she's -- she's dropping down on the ....
... bed .	oh , no -- no !
but -- what's this ? I thought you were going along with me .	oh , no , no , I have to get to her right ....
oh --	but you couldn't have been , could you ?
are you a good witch , or a bad witch ?	who , me ? why , I'm not a witch at all . I'm Dorothy Gale from Kansas .
Toto's my dog .	well , I'm a little muddled . the Munchkins called me because a new witch has just dropped a house on the wicked Witch of the East . and there's the house , and here you are , and that's all ...
the Munchkins are happy because you have freed them from the wicked Witch of the East .	oh . but , if you please -- what are Munchkins ?
the little people who live in this land -- it's Munchkinland , and you are their national heroine , my dear . it's all right -- you may all come out and thank her . it's all right now - you may all come out .	I thought you said she was dead .
oh , I'd give anything to get out of Oz altogether -- but which is the way back to Kansas ? I can't go the way I came .	no -- that's true . the only person who might know would be the great and wonderful Wizard of Oz himself !
oh , very good , but very mysterious . he lives in the Emerald City , and that's a long journey from here . did you bring your broomstick with you ?	no , I'm afraid I didn't .
well , then , you'll have to walk . the Munchkins will see you safely to the border of Munchkinland . and remember , never let those Ruby slippers off your feet for a moment , or you will be at the mercy of the wicked Witch of the West .	but , how do I start for Emerald City ?
oh , will you help me ? can you help me ?	you don't need to be helped any longer . you've always had the power to go back to Kansas .
oh , now ?	whenever you wish .
are you ready now ?	yes . say goodbye , Toto .
what are you going to do with my dog ? give him back to me !	all in good time , my little pretty -- all in good time .
oh , please give me back my dog !	certainly -- certainly -- when you give me those slippers .
but the Good Witch of the North told me not to .	very well ! throw that basket in the river and drown him !
no ! no -- no ! here -- you can have your old slippers -- but give me back Toto .	that's a good little girl . I knew you'd see reason .
ahh ! ah !	I'm sorry . I didn't do it ! can I still have my dog ?
run , Toto , run !	catch him , you fool !
oh ! oh , it feels like my joints are rusted . listen , Dorothy , don't let hunk kid you about Miss Gulch . she's just a poor sour-faced old maid that -- she ain't got no heart left . you know , you should have a little more heart yourself , and have pity on her .	well , gee , I try and have a heart .
this ?	sure . it's to break up winds , so we don't have no more dust storms . can you imagine what it'll mean to this section of the country ? I'll show you . it works perfectly now . here's the principle . you see that fan -- that sends up air currents into the sky . these air currents -- Oh , stop it !
oh !	who did it ? now wait a minute .
Hickory !	now what happened ? I'll bet hunk did that .
oh ! oh , Zeke ! help ! help me , Zeke ! get me out of here ! help !	are you all right , Dorothy ?
Uhhhh -- yes ...	I don't believe you !
Yes-s-s -- that ... that's exactly so . I'm a humbug !	oh ....
frightened ? you are talking to a man who has laughed in the face of death -- sneered at Doom and chuckled at catastrophe . I was petrified . then suddenly the wind changed , and the balloon floated down into the heart of this noble city , where I was instantly acclaimed Oz , the First Wizard de Luxe !	Ohhh !
times being what they were , I accepted the job , -- retaining my balloon against the advent of a quick get-away . and in that balloon , my dear Dorothy , you and I will return to the land of E Pluribus Unum !	oh ! come back ! don't go without me ! please come back !
I can't come back ! I don't know how it works !	oh --
our echo .	tap - tap - tap - tap - What was that - that - that ? our echo - echo - echo .
oh , come on - come on ! we'll soon find the Wizard !	the Wizard - The Wizard - The Great and powerful Wizard of Oz - Oz - Oz-Oz - Oz - Oz - Oz - Oz !
... have you come back ?	please , sir . we've done what you told us . we've brought you the broomstick of the wicked Witch of the West . we melted her .
... resourceful !	yes , sir . so we'd like you to keep your promise to us , if you please , sir .
if you were really great and powerful , you'd keep your promises !	do you presume to criticize the ....
... -- Oz -- has spoken !	who are you ?
well , I -- I -- I am the Great and powerful -- Wizard of Oz .	you are ?
as Mayor of the Munchkin City In the County of the Land of Oz I welcome you most regally	but we've got to verify it legally To see ...
to see ?	if she ...
if she ?	is morally , Ethic'ly
then this is a day of Independence For all the Munchkins and their descendants !	if any !
from now on you'll be history	you'll be hist ...
look at you , Zeke -- you're just as white --	here , here , what's all this jabber-wapping when there's work to be done ? I know three shiftless farm hands that'll be out of a job before they know it !
well , Dorothy was walking along the --	I saw you tinkering with that contraption , Hickory . now , you and hunk get back to that wagon !
all right , Mrs. Gale . but some day they're going to erect a statue to me in this town , and --	well , don't start posing for it now . here , here -- can't work on an empty stomach . have some crullers .
poor little orphan , and her Miss Gulch troubles . gosh all hemlock - you know , she ought to have somebody to play with .	I know , but we all got to work out our own problems , Henry .
yes .	oh , I hope we got them in time .
uhh -- yeah --	now , we can't go against the law , Dorothy . I'm afraid poor Toto will have to go .
Aunt Em !	fifty-seven , fifty-eight --
just listen to what Miss Gulch did to Toto ! she --	Dorothy , please ! we're trying to count ! Fifty-eight--
seventy -- Dorothy , please !	oh , but he doesn't do it every day -- just once or twice a week . and he can't catch her old cat , anyway . and now she says she's gonna get the sheriff , and --
Dorothy ! Dorothy ! we're busy !	oh -- all right .
now , Dorothy , dear , stop imagining things . you always get yourself into a fret over nothing .	no --
Dorothy !	you wicked old witch ! Uncle Henry , Auntie Em , don't let' em take Toto ! don't let her take him -- please !
-- no place like home -- there's no place like home -- no place --	Dorothy . Dorothy , dear . it's Aunt Em , darling .
oh , Auntie Em -- it's you !	yes , darling .
but I did leave you , Uncle Henry -- that's just the trouble . and I tried to get back for days and days .	there , there , lie quiet now . you just had a bad dream .
oh , we dream lots of silly things when we --	no , Aunt Em -- this was a real , truly live place . and I remember that some of it wasn't very nice ....
is this where we're going ?	of course not . we're going to Baltimore . it's much nicer in Baltimore .
momma ... are they angry with us .	no ... No . it is just the English way .
I don't want to stay here .	they are English . they don't understand .
I wish dawdie was with us .	I know . sleep now , Liebchen .
no , you listen . get out !	lady , I'm here to help you . this man is very dangerous . an armed criminal . he's got a gun , hasn't he ?
you might have killed him !	find Fergie , check the barns . I'll watch these two .
get back in there .	my son is out there !
she say where he is ?	I don't think she knows .
what about Carter ?	tight . but I'm working on him .
weird , man . no fuckin' electricity . what do you figure they plug all their shit into ?	they don't have any shit .
he's not in this building .	all right , where is he ?
never seen anything like that in all my years .	he's from ... Ohio ... My cousin .
we'll , them Ohio Amish sure must be different . our Lancaster brethren , they just don't have that kind of fight in them .	John , lost control of himself . he ... will be repentant .
you're Rachel Lapp , aren't you ?	yes . Samuel ! we're going .
who was that man ?	his name is John Book .
is the English dead ?	no ...
that has no place in this house .	I know .
didn't you hear Stoltzfus ? what if he dies ? then the sheriff will come . they'll say we broke their laws –	we'll pray that he doesn't die ! but if he does , then we'll find a way so no one knows !
Rachel , this is a man's life , we hold it in our hands .	I know God help me , I know that , Eli . but I tell you that if he's found here , the people who did this to him will come for Samuel .
Eli , John is a carpenter . as well as being a fine policeman .	eh ? well then , maybe he can go to Zook's barn-raising , eh ? see how good a carpenter .
how can this be ? how can you do such a thing ? is this plain ? is this the ordnung ?	I have done nothing against the ordnung .
eh ? nothing ? Rachel , you bring this man to our house . with his gun of the hand . you bring fear to this house . fear of English with guns coming after . you bring blood and whispers of more blood . now English music ... and you are dancing to English music ! and you call this nothing ?	I have committed no sin .
no sin ? maybe . not yet . but , Rachel , it does not look ... Don't you know there has been talk ? talk about you , not him . talk about going to the Bishop . about having you ... shunned !	that is idle talk .
do not make light of it , Rachel . they can do it ... quick ! like that ! and then ... then I can not sit at table with you . I can not take a thing from your hand . I ... I can not go with you to meeting ! Rachel , good Rachel , you must not go too far ! dear child !	I am not a child .
I will be the judge of that .	no ! they will be the judge of that ! and so will I ... if you shame me !
you shame yourself .	no , Rachel ...
I have to help him !	everything okay ?
yes , thank you very much .	John said you're Amish .
yes .	oh .
good morning .	you didn't have to ...
I wanted to. you were kind to take us in last night . anyway , I needed something to do . I was so angry with your brother . he's so ... agaanisish !	Aganishish ? yeah , that sounds like John .
just a minute . I'll pour you some coffee .	you're not carrying a bullwhip ... how'd you manage to put my kids to work ?
I made it a contest ... the one who does best gets his cereal back first . children like to help ... they only need to be kept after a little bit .	what's so funny ?
Fred . the way he looked when you screamed at him .	God , Fred ...
at home you'd never hear a woman scream at a man that way .	no ? why not ?
you just wouldn't . it's not the Amish way . but I think it would have done me good if I could have screamed at your brother last night .	listen , I don't know what's going on or how you got mixed up with him , but don't you let that self-righteous son of a bitch push you around , okay ?
did you find him ?	not yet .
Elaine , I've come to apologize for Lt. McElroy . he overstated the department's position .	he accused John of taking kickbacks . and you know – anybody who knows John – knows that's a goddamn lie !
of course , Elaine . but as long as there's any question , better Johnny should come back and clear his name .	better you should get off my front porch before I get my mace !
Elaine , I don't want to have to take you in for questioning . you've got his car , you were the last to see him –	I don't know where he is .
you know where he is .	wrong .
you'd lie to protect him .	probably .
you admit you're lying ?	I admit I don't know where he is .
either you're a member of the club or you aren't , Elton . tell me what you know ...	what I know , Paul , is ... He's going to take you out ...
anybody know about this ?	I didn't even know about it .
I got there late , John .	let's just find Coalmine . listen , Zenovich made a mistake . you didn't let anybody down . it happens –
listen carefully , I wrote the Amish woman's name and address on my desk calendar , I want you to lose it for me , Now . tonight .	what the hell are you talking about ? what's happening .
nothing . I'm not going to be around for a while . I'll call you when I can .	Johnny , what the fuck ?
yeah ... I can put it all together when I get back ,' til then , you know nothing , understand ? business as usual ...	I hear you .
it's me .	Johnny ! where the hell have you been ?
never mind . I'm coming in to take care of business . how hot am I ?	too hot . don't do it . don't come in .
I'm coming .	listen , Johnny , don't do anything stupid . you couldn't get within a mile of Schaeffer right now . so stay put ... Stay in touch – I'll let you know when maybe it makes sense .
you hear me ?	I hear you . I'll stay in touch .
that's more like it . where are you at , anyway ?	where I'm at is maybe 1890 .
say again ?	make that 1790 .
I'm a police officer . I'm going to have to talk to the boy . what's his name ?	Samuel . Samuel Lapp . but what happened here is none of his affair . my sister is expecting me ... our train is leaving soon .
where are you taking us ?	we're looking for a suspect . we've reason to believe he's still in the area .
you have no right to keep us here .	yes I do . your son is a material witness to a homicide .
you don't understand , we have nothing to do with your laws !	doesn't surprise me . I meet a lot of people like that .
what was that ?	he wants to know who you are . your name . I told him we don't need to know anything about you .
the problem is I don't happen to think my son should be spending all his time with a man who carried a gun under his coat and goes around whacking people .	whacking ?
yes . and I also want to leave this city .	believe me , I'm trying to get this over with as fast as I can . but Samuel will probably have to come back and testify .
we do not go into your courts .	people who don't go into our courts when they're told to sometimes go directly into our jail .
look , I'm genuinely sorry ...	no you're not – You're glad , because now you've got a witness . I heard the other police talking last night . they don't seem to like you very much .
they kid a lot .	I would not be too sure .
but not a good tired .	what's a' good' tired . tired is tired .
your sister said you don't have a family ?	no .
she thinks you should get married and have children of your own . instead of trying to be a father to hers . except she thinks you're afraid of the responsibility .	oh ? anything else ?
why don't you arrest that man ? are you protecting him because policeman ?	listen , I'm the cop that polices the police . I'm not in the business of protecting crooked cops . I'll make an arrest when I know everybody involved .
but why would they murder ...	because – somehow – they knew I was getting close . look , it's narcotics ... They make dope out of chemicals ... they sell it on the street for millions of dollars . they'll do anything . and they can get away with it because they're cops .
I'm afraid . I'm afraid for Samuel . I want to go home .	you'll be safe . you don't have to worry .
home .	you couldn't wait until morning ?
you said we would be safe in Philadelphia .	I was wrong .
stay for awhile . rest . I'll make coffee and breakfast .	I can't .
but John ... why didn't you go to a hospital ?	no , no doctor ...
but why ?	gunshot ... they'll file reports ... they'll find me .
who are they ?	the leadership of our district ... the diener . Bishop Tschantz is the one with no hair on top . they decided to come and see you for themselves . except Stoltzfus , of course . he came the first day . I think he saved your life .
only the elders .	how long ?
what ?	how long have I been here ?
two days .	listen , thank you . thanks for everything . but I've got to go .
John Book , I would appreciate it if , during the time you are with us , you would have as little to do with Samuel as possible .	nobody meant any harm . the boy was curious . I unloaded the gun -
enjoying your reading ?	very interesting . I'm learning a lot about manure . what's that ?
your shirt and jacket are still stained with blood . I have them soaking.You can wear these .	your husband's ?
something wrong with buttons ?	buttons are Hochmut .
Hochmut ?	vain . proud . such a person is Hochmutsnarr . he is not plain .
anything against zippers ?	you make fun of me . like the tourists . driving by all the time . some even come into the yard . very rude . they seem to think we are quaint .
telephone ? the Gunthers across the valley . they're Mennonite . they have cars and refrigerators and telephones in the houses even .	no . I'd want a public phone .
well ... the store at Saltzburg ... But you won't be going to Saltzburg for a while .	I'm going this morning .
but Stoltzfus said ...	I know what he said .
the ... bullets ?	oh . the bullets .
Eli is a fine carpenter . best in the district . he and his father built the big house themselves forty years ago .	oh ? what happened to Hochstetler ?
we had some lemonade and he left .	a real fireball .
you know carpentry ?	I did some carpentry summers when I was going to school .
what else can you do ?	I can whack people . I'm hell at whacking .
whacking is not of much use on a farm .	now hold on . there's a lot of people who think being a cop is a legitimate job .
but ... You may not be well enough .	I'll drink some more of Stoltzfus' tea .
when will you be going ?	not long ... A few days .
won him over just like that .	I see . but I hope you have a lot of sugar . Eli is ready to go to Zook's .
you should not bother with that birdhouse . if you're leaving tomorrow .	I'm leaving tonight . I'm going to need my clothes . and my gun .
there was a time when I thought you might have stayed .	there was .
there was a time when I would have welcomed it .	I know .
I was being foolish ?	no . I was being unrealistic . even thinking about living this life .
you're so sure of that ?	aren't you ? after today ?
I'm not so sure of anything as you are , John Book . you could live this life if you wanted to bad enough . just as I could live yours !	oh , come on , Rachel . no way .
there is always a way ! but you are such a ... a Glotzkopp you cannot see ! you'd rather go back to that city ! to nothing ! no woman ! no children ! no land !	land ! are you crazy ? I'm no Amishman and I'm no farmer ! I'm a cop . that's what I know and that's what I do !
what you do is take vengeance ! which is a sin against heaven !	that's your way , not mine .
that's God's way !	well in the City of Philadelphia , God needs a little help !
I want you to take this ... to remember by .	where's my baggy pants ?
how reliable is this kid ?	oh , he's good .
Amish .	yeah .
what have you got ?	Zenovitch was about to deliver a list of names tonight – street chemists ... the guys processing this P2P into speed .
so one of them got to him .	maybe .
you know who ?	maybe .
you're still convinced there's a link to the department ?	if there isn't I've just wasted the last six months .
that's the problem . we need results . the press is driving us crazy over this P2P thing . calling us the' speed capitol of the country' . you know the sort of thing . it's getting political . the Commissioner's getting very uneasy .	the Amish boy saw him , Paul . I'll make it , but Set Donahue and the Homicide Department off my back or they'll blow the whole thing .
what's-her-name moved to Buffalo .	well , anyway , don't get crazy . I'll do something for Zenovich's wife .
last guy I would have figured . but he's part of it .	I hope you don't have any doubts about that .
if I did , I'd have kept my mouth shut ... It fits , Paul ... fifty-five gallons of P2P confiscated four years ago ... Guess who was in on the collar ? Mac . he salts it away somewhere ... he knows the stuff is potent , but the street chemists haven't figured out how to process it . but they do now . and now the stuff is worth five-grand a pint and there are a lot of pints in a fifty-five gallon drum .	who else knows ?
just us .	okay , what are you going to need to clean it up
more people ... Gotta pick up where Zenovich left off . people from outside the department .	maybe the Bureau . or those bastards at Treasury . I'll take care of it . I hate this shit , Johnny . you cut their balls off for me . I'm counting on you .
what's your first move ?	a hot shower ... I haven't changed clothes in two days .
who else knows ?	just us .
you made a mistake , Paul . you shouldn't have taken Elton out .	how bad did Mac get you ? we figured pretty bad .
Johnny –	you might want to pass it along to Mac .
listen to me , Johnny . come in ! you're out there all alone ... We're getting close ... real close ... Maybe if you listen to me for a minute we can work something out so you can come in –	I've already got something worked out . be seeing you .
it's all over , Paul .	move ! or you die right here !
I saw him .	who'd you see ?
who'd you see , Sam ? the man on the floor ?	no ... I saw the man who killed him .
he was ... like him .	black ... I understand . what else , Sam ?
you ever handle a pistol like this , Samuel ?	no pistol . ever .
tell you what – I'm going to let you handle this one . but only if you promise not to say anything to your momma . I've got a feeling she wouldn't understand .	okay , Mr. Book .
that's Luke . he doesn't like strangers .	you don't say .
hey , Sam ...	... I want to say a thing .
is it them ?	it's them , Sam . now , Sam , listen to me and listen to me carefully . listen to me as you never listened before .
are they going to kill you ?	listen to me , Sam ! I want you to go across the new corn to Stoltzfus' . run as fast as you can . and stay there !
what are you going to do ?	I'll be all right . you just do as I say .
don't let them hurt you .	I won't . now run . fast as you can !
are you really ever coming back ?	got to , Sam . you and I are going to a courthouse together , put some people behind bars .
have you got your gun on now ?	sure have , Sam .
good morning . book , is it ? you are the Yankee they talk about ?	I thought I was the English .
Eli says you're a carpenter , Book .	it's been a while .
your hole is healed , then ?	pretty much .
nail it !	yes , sir .
everything is all right , John .	pick up the hat .
how could you do this to me tonight ? I told you I had company	sorry . it's important .
where's Timmy and Buck ?	upstairs , asleep . where'd you think ?
you've got a man here and the kids are upstairs ?	that's none of your goddamn business ! so keep your goddamn holier-than- thou mouth shut ! anyway , they like Fred .
oh sure , Fred .	who are these orphans , anyway ?
put my car in the garage and close the door .	John , I don't understand any of this .
you don't know anything ... borrowed your car . didn't say why . and you never heard of that woman and her boy .	John , why ? ...
sure , I'm sorry . hope you don't mind me plugging in to your battery . mine's dead ... How can I help ? what can I do ?	maybe milking .
milking ?	cows . you know , cows ?
I've seen pictures .	good , you start tomorrow .
eat up , Book . what's the matter with your appetite ?	guess I'm not used to so much .
we are emissaries of her majesty , Queen Cherlindrea , of the land of Coshairm .	Queen Cherlindrea ?
she requests the presence of your- self and the young princess .	who ? ?
I'm getting her out of there !	no ! you let us handle this . come along , Rool !
Ohhh , I hate this .	take your time . don't worry about the elves . they won't come out here .
this is not going well .	hurry ! Queen Cherlindrea will know what to do .
talk ! say something !	I can't see anything--she's too bright !
hey , careful there !	how do these work I wonder ? I got- ta save one to show the High Aldwin .
we've traveled a long way . we're looking for fin Raziel .	the sorceress .
obviously .	without Raziel we'll never find Tir Asleen . we'd better go .
this can't be right . this isn't a sorceress . this is some kind of animal .	Queen Bavmorda transformed her .
if you rest the baby on your shoulder , she'll stop crying .	shut up .
I changed her already !	she needs to be changed again . Sorsha crosses her arms in a hugg and watches as Willow changes the baby . soon the baby stops crying . re- lieved yet still anxious , Sorsha paces to a mirror . Willow rocks the baby gently , absently looking at the fire . then his eyes focus on the fire .
who is that horrible friend of yours ?	Madmartigan .
who is he ?	I don't know much about him .
she's hungry .	I know she's hungry . I tried to feed her but she wouldn't eat a thing . I'm not a wet nurse .
here . hold her .	Elves ! they're always tormenting babies . they make them cry and take their tears .
watch this . right between the eyes .	he never misses .
I'm not going in there .	me neither !
are you sure ?	yes ! Raziel ! she lives out on that island !
us ? ? we'll never catch them . any- way , we're all done , Teemo . let's go home .	get back here , Rool !
who are you ! who are you !	I'm Willow Ufgood . I'm here to find fin Raziel .
what do you want !	we need your help . to take this baby to Tir Asleen . she's a prin- cess .
kill him !	no !
no .	a magician * makes * magic . any fool can use it .
you must learn magic .	that's all I ever wanted !
Willow . to learn magic , first you must make your own philosopher's stone !	what do I need for that ?
I hope she's all right . how much more do I have to do of this ?	till it's in a powder . the energy exits within you ...
I know , and the magician's goal is to find his true self . but what's this got to do with it ?	as below , so above . you hold the univers , Willow , in your hand .
I'm all finished . now what ?	burn it to a fine Ash .
how am I gonna do that ?	patience . concentrate . you will find a way .
we don't have much time left ! go on ! go on !	I must concetrate my imagination ... to creat a new ... reality !
what's the magician's weapon ?	the limitless power of ...
your will ! your will ! what else could it be ?	I can't remember all these things . what am I learning ?
the art of transformation !	but what am I gonna transform ? ?
Oooh , this smells terrible .	that's the life spark . Exxence of magic and sorcery !
Ouch ! !	Shhhhh !
what'd you bit me for ! !	we need blood . to nourish the stone. charge the stone with ener- gy .
again : what is the magician's weapon ?	his will .
now use it .	I just wanted to test it first .
Tir Asleen .	there's nobody here .
how ? ?	use the philosopher's stone ! Hur- Ry ! Invocation ! release them !
I did it ! Madmartigan ! come here ! look ! you gotta see this ! I did it !	more ! more !
Raziel ! I transformed them all ! I'm a magician !	you didn't transform them , Willow , you released them . that was noth- ing . now change me .
get down ! the ritual chant ! quick ! protect yourself !	why ?
just do it !	I've come all this way and now Elora Dana's going to die !
no ! I can still defeat Bavmorda !	she's too powerful , Raziel
time is running out .	surrender ! !
it's not a Nelwyn baby .	no , it's too big to be a Nelwyn baby . it looks like a daikini ...
can't we keep it , dada ?	absolutely not .
Daikinis are giant people who live far far away .	are you scared ?
I could be you rguard ! I could carry your spear !	what a great son you are , Ranon . I wish I could take you with me . now go to sleep ...
please ? I'm dyin' of Thirst in here .	good . how long will it take ?
don't make me angry , Peck .	you be careful . I'm a powerful sorcerer . I could turn you into a toad just like that .
do any other daikinis ever come by here ?	why .
thanks for your help , Peck .	are you okay ?
as if you care . I saved your life , Peck . those guys woulda killed us ! you wanna give your baby to them ? ? they eat babies !	I don't know .
you a woodcutter ?	Farmer .
you all right ?	these burns . my arms . Ouch ...
are you a warrior ?	the greatest swordsman that ever lived .
what's that ? I hear something !	you hear trouble .
I'll be around long after you're dead , Airk ! you slime ! when I get outa here I'll cut your head off and stick it on a pig-pole !	friend of yours ?
whatcha thinkin' about , Willow ?	I hate this .
nobody's gonna take your baby . know why ? nobody cares ... Except me . you wanna go back to your farm . you wanna go back to your family . I could take care of that baby . I'll look after her like she was me own .	you don't know anything about ba- bies .
you gotta promise to feed her .	I will .
fresh goat's milk .	absolutely !
and give her a bath everyday , and don't let her get cold . and keep her diaper changed .	of course ! I promise !
here are her diaper rags . and this is her milk bladder . and when she cries--she's either hungry or she's tired--rock her on your left shoulder . she likes that .	don't worry , Willow . she's in good hands . you haven't made a mistake .
you ! !	where the hell did you come from ?
hey ! give me that baby !	these Pecks make terrible nurse- maids .
time to change her diaper .	time to leave .
where's the baby ? ?	I thought you had her !
now Willow , I know you're gonna blame me for this but it wasn't my fault ... !	Elora Danan !
Madmartigan ! you saved her life !	I did ?
so you're on your way to Tir Asleen , huh ? I hate to tell you this , Willow , but Tir Asleen dosn't exist .	yes it does . the Fairy Queen told me .
Madmartigan , I need your help .	my help ? a great magician like you ? you don't need any help .
I was in love once , Willow . she had a hold on my heart . I could barely function . I * was * a great swordsman ! I was knighted ! I could have been king !	you ?
I'll help you ... !	I won't .
I'm beginning to think you two * deserve * to be locked up .	the universe is a living creature , like you and me , Madmartigan .
did she ask about me ?	who ?
come on , Peck , don't give me a hard time . you were in her ten all night . did she say anything ?	she said lots of thing.s
Willow !	she asked about you , Madmartigan .
she's in love .	you're crazy . I think you're in love .
you ?	what are you gonna become , Raziel ? Queen of the rodents ?
Madmartigan ! I can't stand being in closed-in places .	want me to carry Elora ?
Willow ... this may be a bad time to ask this question but ... what if Raziel's wrong ?	she can't be wrong . she's a very very very powerful sorceress .
she's a bird , Willow .	that's my fault , not hers . I've got to keep practicing . I'm still in the learning stage but magic , Madmartigan , requires concentration and--
watch it !	ahhh !
I have an idea . back in my village we catch a lot of hedgehogs .	Willow , this is war , not agricul- ture !
I don't know , Willow .	Madmartigan , you promised me you'd take care of Elora Danan like your own daughter . she is all that matters . are you going to abandon her ?
Willow , why don't you use your mag- ic to get us out of here ?	he's no magician .
then you get us out of here .	I will ! but I need help !
who is that girl , anyway ?	Sorsha , Queen Bavmorda's daughter .
we're a tiny version of all that ?	as above , so below .
Bavmorda cannot transform you . I've protected this camp with a spell .	can you use your magic to get our men into the fortress , Raziel ?
you ! are you the mother of that child ?	no . I mean yes .
I can't .	let me see it .
I can't .	why not ?
Gawd ... you're ... beautiful ...	you're not a woman .
Mmmm , I love the smell of a woman .	my step-father's going to tear you apart .
I do what I'm told .	too bad you're not more like your father .
you're a fool . now put her back .	I'm not going to let this baby die .
say what ?	I love you .
because it's true .	I don't believe you .
Sorsha .	Madmartigan .
sir ! I have to talk to you .	not today , Willow .
earlier today you tried to tell me something , Willow .	my family found this baby in the river , High Aldwin .
now , you know where you're going ? down there , through those trees , follow the river . you'll know the crossroads by a big daikini struc- ture . Willow , this is serious business . don't waste any time , the outer world is no place for a Nelwyn . give the baby to the first daikini you see , then hurry home as fast as you can .	if I'm not strong enough to be your apprentice , how can I do this ?
you're strong enough . but you're going to need courage , Willow .	I don't want courage . I don't want to be a warrior . all I've ever wanted was to do magic , real magic , like you !
oh , if I could do that I'd--I'd turn Burglekutt into a toad !	waste magic on revenge ? you have much to learn , Willow ...
Willow Ufgood .	yes ... ?
you mean , you know who this baby belongs to ?	she belongs to all of us . she is the future queen and ruler of all kingdoms on earth .
no , Willow . your journey has just begun . it has been foretold that this child shall bring about the Downfall of Queen Bavmorda , whose evil powers have darkened our world . upon you depends this princess's life .	me ?
you are the guardian , Willow . you must take her to Tir Asleen .	what is Tir Asleen ?
you need a warrior for this job . I'm nobody .	you are very important , Willow .
they look like acorns .	anything you hurl them at will turn to stone .
we're going into battle , little one . find a woman to take care of it .	he thought you were a woman , Airk !
Madmartigan ! what did you do this time ?	nothing you wouldn't have done it my place !
I always knew you'd end up in a crow's cage .	least I'm not down there herding sheep !
Airk ! come on , Airk . lemme outa here .	hey , remember ? you don't need my help , Madmartigan . little rabbit trap like this ? come on ! I could open it for you , but I wouldn't wanna insult you !
you left me to die , friend .	you managed alright .
it's you they're after , Madmarti- gan . what did you do this time ?	they're not after me . they want the baby .
you gonna be a hero , Madmartigan ? I've lost half my men fighting Kael , and Bavmorda , and the Nock- maar army . now you and this Peck , and that magpie up in the rafters , are gonna take' em on alone ?	then come with us .
you're chasing a dream .	just get me some horses .
out for a little ride in the coun- try , Airk ?	thought you might get lonely , mad- martigan !
thank you , friend .	let's go .
well ?	they're coming .
when are they coming ?	they're rounding up a posse . figure an hour ?
in an hour they're gone !	hey ... !
you're not going to use it , are you ?	well , come on , that's half a dozen armed men ...
yes !	gotta get the Doctor someplace safe .
who were they ? what do they want with me ?	we'll explain on the way .
"I only met him once , but that was enough . for such a little man he had quite an oversized opinion of himself . he offered me the "" rare and unparalleled opportunity "" to develop a new steam engine for him . he claims to have some sort of factory in Texas , I believe . said I could have the run of the place . he had all sorts of specifications . but when I questioned him closely , it became obvious he was just another mercenary businessman . both he and his partner had no real love of steam . it's sad . so few men do ."	who was this partner of his ?
a Southern gentlemen . I don't recall his name . I suppose it's unkind of me to say it , but he had the most disconcerting glass eye .	a glass eye ? that's who it was ! one-eyed Jack Garrison . otherwise known as General Garrison , Confederate Third Army . I saw him at Dr. Loveless' party , but I couldn't place him . he used to wear an eye-patch .
are you all right ?	for the moment . but I fear not for long . I'm of no use to him now .
he ... he's planning to kill us , isn't he ?	he's just full of plans that aren't gonna work out .
it's a smelting retort .	now it's a bomb .
I beg your pardon ?	you don't know what he's built ? ! surely you don't think he kidnapped all those geniuses to have them make something as rudimentary as this .
I admire a man with a sense of humor .	when you're three and a half feet tall , sir , life turns you into a comedian whether you like it or not .... Come with me , won't you ?
I must compliment you on Miss Thompson ... an exceptionally charming assistant .	thank you . I confess to a preoccupation with acquiring precisely that which the world says I cannot have .
very good , sir ! I think my guest might be a sharpshooter by trade .	no , sir ... just a businessman .
really ? must be a dangerous business .	I deal with some tough customers .
sir ... I believe you have only two barrels .	how embarrassing . did I hold up three fingers ?
why don't we just cut this routine short ? whatever you do to us , we're not going to talk .	talk ? about what ... ? oh ! about who you are and all that ?
you're not that big .	restrain yourself , Voltaire . he's just the sort of coward who would shoot an unarmed giant .
still alive . hmm . I suppose that doesn't bode well for poor Bruno .	he had a pressing engagement .
Philistine .	you got that right . now get up . we're walking out of here .
has it penetrated that adrenaline- addled skull that you are surrounded by seventy-eight of my loyal followers ? you are in my domain !	has it penetrated yours that I'm holding a gun on their leader ?
the U.S. is my jurisdiction .	exactly ! you are on foreign soil . you are a representative of the occupying forces . or haven't you checked a map lately ? !
these lands were taken by force from Mexico in the illegal War of American aggression .	that would be ... the Mexican War ?
I've even printed my own currency .	""" Emperor Miguelito ... ? """
the first .	well , your highness , what makes you think we'll ever sign a treaty with you ?
because I am holding all the western territories hostage , Mr. West ! a town a day will disappear ! Willard was merely a test run , a stroll in the park . next , I level all of Albuquerque ! yes , that's right . only yesterday I learned what you undoubtedly already know : your own President will be there . what an added bonus ! the gods are shining on me ! after tomorrow every American citizen will rise up and demand I be given back my humble little empire !	so , I'm the only one here who can tell the difference between an Emperor and a murderer ?
Mr. President , good to see you again , sir . sorry about all that .	that'll be all , boys .
good work . really .	this is Colonel Richards .
but what would anyone have to gain from all this ... ? unless it were a foreign power .	exactly . any number of nations would love to cripple our scientific growth . and what better way to tip the scales in their favor than by killing off the greatest minds this country has produced .
we find ourselves at the dawn of the Golden Age of Science . and it is the God-given destiny of this glorious nation to carry the torch that lights the way !	nicely said , sir .
and ?	and now the job's yours .
... well , of course you can . Mr. President , what a surprise . what brings you here ?	on my way to Denver ...
where'd he say he was going to do this ?	he didn't . that's your job . I'm taking you off that other case until you've nabbed this lunatic . good luck . nice train . but mine's nicer .
don't try to bamboozle me , Colonel . has another scientist been kidnapped or not ?	well , yes sir . a Professor Morton , but with just a little more time , sir , I can assure you a breakthrough on this case ...
listen , in two days I'm embarking on a tour of the western territories . and I want to know at least one problem is being handled competently in my absence .	of course , sir , that's why I've assigned a new man . and he's no ordinary Marshal . he's quite sophisticated . three college degrees . a master of disguise . speaks French ...
French ?	yes sir .
French ? damn it , I want my own man on this case . somebody I trust . somebody who doesn't mind breaking up the furniture !	why surely , Mr. President , there must be some mistake . I mean ...
look , I'm Captain James West ...	well , Captain , then the answer is your train is still here .
your private train , sir .	private train ?
would you be thinking ... ramming speed , sir ?	I would , Mr. Doyle ! are you game ?
my name's Tyler . Frank Tyler . pleased to meet you , ma'am .	I get that feeling . you know , Mr. Tyler , I'm the kind of woman who doesn't believe men are much more than a complete waste of time . but after spying you across the room , I'm tempted to suspend my disbelief , at least for the evening .
you know , ma'am , you remind me of a pearl-handled pistol I once owned . a beautiful thing to look at , but too hot to handle .	I don't recollect ever being compared to a pistol before .
please do . I'm a man who appreciates a good firearm .	really ?
well , where I come from it kind of goes with the territory . Texas .	my ... the wild west .
well , sir , you are proving to be one of my more interesting guests .	your guests , ma'am ?
well , I owe you one , don't I ?	you most certainly do .
you must excuse the Doctor . no one has ever beaten him at his little game .	I don't like to lose , either .
have you taken a wrong turn , Mr. Tyler ?	you tell me .
forgive me , but you don't strike me as the social secretary type .	thank you . but the truth is , I'm a single woman in a man's world . that leaves me very few choices , doesn't it ?
just a little insurance ... against the unexpected .	would that include me ?
oh , I would hope not .	you've ... done ... this ... before .
she's perfectly safe .	really ? like General Garrison or didn't you hear all that shooting ?
my . it's gotten longer .	you bring the best out in a man .
you know , I really hate being toyed with before someone shoots me .	fine , I'll stop .
a new friend ?	we'll see .
anyone ?	here . Mr. Tyler . he claims a certain skill at handling firearms .
they don't even realize they should be frightened .	well , let's help them with that . take the legs .
terribly sorry . I'm always sticking this where it doesn't belong . Federal agents , ma'am . we're rescuing a kidnap victim ...	yes , me !
he's not giving up ?	well , see , he had this little wagon when he was a kid ...
time for you to get off , Ma'am .	like hell ! I'll see it through ! Ram the bastard !
J. S. Bach .	Jim West .
Artemus Gordon . Bach , he's the composer .	I don't mind him , but who the hell are you ... my valet or something ?
valet ? you jest of course . I am a U.S. Marshal .	funny . so am I.
congratulations . unfortunately , my train is about to leave , and I really must insist you disembark .	your train ? listen , friend , you're obviously lost . ... I've got orders here to take possession of this train and to investigate a certain crime .
interesting . mine say the same thing , and they don't mention you , not even as a valet , although we could talk ...	just another bureaucratic foul-up . you know how these pencil-pushers are . so , why don't you just run on back and explain what happened ?
funny , I was just thinking you should do the same . since I am already in residence , and am obviously the man for the job , it's been grand making your acquaintance , sir . and best of luck in all your future endeavors .	you're quite the wordsmith , fiddle boy . but nobody smooth-talks his way into my assignment .
but don't pull that again .	wouldn't dream of it .
eight scientists . eight different fields of endeavor . Hydraulics , optics , ballistics ...	put them all together and what do we have ?
a giant ... hydraulically operated microscope ... that explodes ? or maybe just someone who hates scientists .	then why kidnap them ? why not just kill them ?
wait a minute . now I know where I've heard of you . you're the gadget guy .	""" gadget guy ? "" while I may not be in a league with these unfortunate geniuses , I am , sir , in my own humble way , a man of science ."
attractive buttons , yes ? but yank one off , toss it , and poof ! it emits a cloud of sleeping gas .	you need that real often ?
always hoping . or this ...	no offense , but all I ever need ... Are these ... And this .
all right , if it'll make you happy , I'll try that .	try what ?
your little jack-in-the-box gun . that might be useful .	well ... it's the only one I have . it's gotten me out of quite a few tight spots ...
that should put us ahead of the criminals .	I'll work on it .
Aha !	Aha ?
yes , aha . a brass screw .	is this leading somewhere ?
potentially . this is the painstaking process of piecing together clues . the cornerstone of the modern science of criminology . piece by piece we reconstruct the identity of the villain .	starting with a screw ?
yes . starting with a screw . now , it's not fair of me to expect someone who's spent his life wrangling with Western desperadoes to fully appreciate what I'm doing here , but ...	what about the explosive ?
Limestone quarry ?	Limestone quarry , Southern mansion . easy to get them mixed up ... I say we invite ourselves to the party .
Doyle , once around the park . I need a moment to prepare .	prepare what ?
come Llewellyn , don't tarry .	call me that again , and you're going to find a boot where it doesn't belong .
that's a lot of butler .	quite . come , let's mingle .
doctor V. L. Pemberton . I knew it . he's a scientist all right . Inventor of the Pemberton condensed steam engine . I'm telling you , Artemus , Loveless is our man .	whoa , Jim . maybe . but we can't arrest this little pillar of society on maybe .
you know your Morse Code almost as well as I.	almost ?
yes . now , observe ....	you feeling all right ?
"you're either having a seizure or you just said "" hello . """	good , I wasn't sure you were up to it .
what was all that back there ?	all what ?
all that jumping and kicking .	that ? oh , it's a kind of Chinese fighting ... I was sort of caught once with a lovely Chinese girl out in San Francisco . her big brothers were kind enough to teach it to me I've got a book on it , if you're interested .
Garrison ... ? then the President was right . except it's not a foreign power , it's a bunch of die- hard Rebels trying to make the South rise again .	and if they've got Dr. Loveless building weapons like those flying bombs ... they just might do it .
could I just point out , this is a perfect example of the criminal mind exploiting modern invention .	I'm going to hit you .
at least I tried something .	hey , I tried the board .
damn it , this is ridiculous .	at least the thing's not that fast . we just follow it . whenever it stops , we're there , waiting .
Jim , are you all right ?	no , I'm not all right . they got away . and we can't even follow them . they can get off the tracks anywhere they want .
what way is that ?	so ... spontaneous . all that leaping off buildings and Chinese fighting and whatnot .
""" spontaneous . "" I like that . most people say something like "" hare- brained reckless son-of-a-bitch . """	well ... that , too .
nothing much to it really . when I was younger I got into a pretty bad run-in with the Wyler Boys . I saw them coming . but I didn't act fast enough . Second-guessed myself . and it cost me ... cost me dearly .	so ... what happened ?
those kids , they took my wagon . never got it back .	uh ... how long ago was this ?
you might have mentioned you had that .	I thought all you needed were your fists and your gun .
strange ... you'd think he'd have this place better guarded .	I find most criminals slip up somewhere ...
they're so precious when they're asleep .	you really enjoy yourself , don't you ?
can you fill me in here ?	sure . we have no idea what's going on .
thank you .	come on , let's at least see if we can find Dr. Pemberton .
know what this is ?	sure . it's a wind-up ... thing .
this is good .	shhh ! come on . tell us something !
oh , damn ! that's it .	it's better than nothing .
sounds like a train . looks like a train .	yes . and a much nicer one than ours .
Willard ...	it's not a guy ...
relax . we're almost there .	we oughta get a couple of those rockets . Voom ! we're there before we left !
what is that ?	this ? I'm testing a new spirit gum , to see how it holds .
and people are actually fooled by that ?	my disguises have helped me solve many a difficult case . I spent three years on the stage , you know . remind me sometime to regale you with my Lear .
not again .	I adjusted it .
when we find him , he is mine .	oh , no , we split him fifty-fifty .
what if these tracks are just leading us to an Indian village or some old coot's mining claim ?	not likely . there must be tracks of twenty different wagons . freight wagons , carriages , buckboards ...
excellent detective work , sir . you should have the honor of going first .	oh , thank you .
my pleasure .	Artemus , you ready for this ? his next target is Albuquerque .
what ? President Grant is ... !	I know ! I know !
I don't have to tell you what that would do to our careers !	we've got to stop him right here , now ! with that armored steam engine of his it'll be a slaughter .
I'd love to stop him , but have you noticed the hundred armed men ?	there's only seventy-eight .
it was in your book .	well , hell , maybe we do have a chance .
are those just button buttons or ... ?	of course not .
God in heaven , what is that ? !	that's ... that's the criminal mind about to stomp our sorry butts !
my God ! he's so excessive !	where have you been ?
pull the balloon right in front of him ! we'll board the damn thing !	oh , I see , an easy plan !
the machine was stopped ! it seemed like a perfect time to disable it ! why'd you have to throw it into full throttle ? !	he was going to shoot me ! do you mind ? !
all right , all right ... It'll be okay . I mean , eventually it'll just run out of steam .	in the next two minutes ?
Artemus ! look at that . brand spanking new . she's a beauty , huh ? let's get rolling .	what is this ? a whole new train ?
what ? you're going to drive off without even saying hi ?	hi , Sandy .
why don't you come in , have a drink ?	can't . got a passenger .
I can't , Sandy . I've got to run .	I'll bet . look , Sam . why don't you come by this weekend . we'll take the boat out ...
sorry , Sandy . I've got plans .	what ? running over alligators with that silly swamp jalopy when you could be sailing a real boat ...
Sandy ... What's up ?	listen , Kelly skipped school . have you talked to her ?
shit . here we go again .	didn't you see her this morning ?
look . I know you're seeing Barbara Baxter . so what ?	so maybe I'm a one-woman man .
grab a clue , Sam . you're a hired hand around here . enjoy it while it lasts .	goodbye , Sandra .
how much is about six and a half million divided by three ?	Jesus . two million one hundred thirty-three thousand three hundred thirty-three and change .
Sam ...	put Kelly on too .
but I ..	shut up . don't fall apart . the only people who can blow this is us . remember ?
yeah , right .	good . just keep telling yourselves that , the only people who can fuck this up is us .
I was worried about you , Suzie . I decided we should all get together , one more time , before we split up .	are you mad at me ?
that was about as grim as it gets .	the guy was history when he killed Kelly . you knew that .
but then you knew what he was like all along ... Maybe his killing Kelly was a thing you had counted on ...	but then it is better this way , don't you think ? no loose ends .
what ?	that was the same thing Ray said .
seems to like some of the same places you do . funny you never met .	yeah , real funny . you're wrong about this , I could get busted on the spot .
I've seen you out there in your old air boat , thinking about what might have been , old man Van Ryan hadn't fucked you out of it . what if I told you I had a way we could get a big piece of it back ?	we ?
how ...	Walter . he's been aimin' that Brownie through knotholes for years . I saw these , I knew he'd finally struck gold . I can't decide which came out better , that little straw Kelly's got up her nose , or that vibrator you've got up her ass . what do you think , Mr. Lombardo ?
why don't you tell us one more time , how Kelly came to be with you , alone in your house .	story's the same , Detective ...
I had to go look for this coupon .	the one you bought at school .
like I said , I hadn't really expected to use it . anyway , I'm going through a drawer . I hear a car . I look out the window . I see Nicole driving away . I leave my room , and there's Kelly .	in cutoffs , a wet T-shirt .
yes .	and she wanted to talk .
yes .	but you can't tell us what she wanted to talk about .
I could , but it's confidential . look , the point is , we didn't talk . I told her this was not an appropriate time or place .	and she began to cry . and you put an arm around her .
but she ran away .	that's right .
but you do admit to touching her , to putting your arm around her . isn't that against the rules ?	it is and I don't . ordinarily ... But , I mean ... there's this kid standing in front of you crying ...
with a thirty-five inch bustline in a wet T-shirt with no bra ...	fuck you . this is bullshit . I'm outta here .
yeah , well , you fixed that . what the hell happened , anyway ?	the bitch shot me , is what happened .
hey , what did you want me to do , die ?	well , shit , you're the cop , they don't teach you to disarm people , shoot them in the leg or something ? you weren't supposed to kill her for Christ's sake .
did you become squeamish about these things before or after you bludgeoned little Suzie Toller to death with a wine bottle ? Jesus , man . it couldn't have worked out better . they're convinced Kelly whacked Suzie . I can't talk' em out of it . we should be celebrating . this thing worked out just like you said , only better .	Kelly was supposed to be framed , not killed . what I'm telling you is , I don't like surprises .
you mean this thing ?	yes , we call it a winch . and these are shrouds , and these are stays .
I thought this was supposed to be a vacation . why didn't you buy a nice big power boat ?	come on , man . I'll make a sailor out of you yet .
yeah , or get me drowned .	Jesus , man ... You okay ?
that how you planned it ? you take cut Suzie , get me to hang it on Kelly , then dump me in the ocean ...	come off it , man ... It was an accident .
meet my partner , Gloria Perez .	I did . at Blue balls .
it's Celine . he's okay . he had a pretty good line on what cheap fucks people are .	so Suzie , you called us , remember ?
no .	will they ?
it doesn't look like it .	then he'll be back at Blue balls ?
you ought to watch it with that shit , Suzie . you get busted again , you go back in a two-tine loser .	you got something against cigarettes ?
that's cop bullshit .	well , you're half right . best thing you could do for yourself right now would be to talk to me .
about what ?	every triangle I've ever seen never lasts . somebody's got to go .
is this supposed to mean something to me ? what triangle ?	you , Kelly , Sam .
I don't have to listen to this . and you can't shove me around . I have friends now ...	is that what you think ? you have friends ? is that what they told you ?
I don't mean who you're thinking . I have other friends ...	Suzie , Suzie ... This is me , Ray , you're talking to . we both know you don't have shit , never have had shit , never will have shit ...
get away from me .	don't you see what this means ? you really think Sam and Kelly are gonna give you a third of the money ? you , the pill-head with the rap sheet ?
Davy .	that's right . that was his name .
you ... I should've killed you myself. should never have left it up to him ...	shoulda , coulda , woulda ... Get him in the water .
Sam , for godsake .	hey , Ray . guess whose name is on the numbered bank account besides yours and Sam's ?
you're saying that Kelly was raped by Sam Lombardo .	that's right .
who is it ?	detective Duquette , Ms. Van Ryan . let me in . now .
where is she ?	where she lives . in the guest house . now will you tell me what this is about ?
I'm placing your daughter under arrest .	you can't ...
but check this ...	Ken . I'm in some trouble . I need an attorney and you're the only one I know . so I figured I'd start here .
good thinking .	you can tie whoever did it to Sandra Van Ryan ...
forget it .	lady has some deep pockets . that's all I'm saying .
what's that supposed to mean ?	for you to be getting this kind of heat , for what they have on you ... It doesn't add up . Sandra Van Ryan's got' em running scared . and I'll tell you something else , you rush , you get careless .
Nellie Gail Ranch ...	sound nice ? it's a fucking drug rehab farm . it's where Kelly Van Ryan went when her morn fished her out of the swamp . meanwhile , you get educator of the year I mean there's no way they can put this thing in front of a jury . shit , they haven't even taken your statement yet . reason ? they're still shoveling dirt and my guess is , they're coming up empty . now tell me I'm right .
there's nothing for them to get .	good . so what we're going to do is march right to Hunter's doorstep . we're going to insist they take a statement . we're going to tell them to charge your ass or get off your back . they're walking a fine line here . Defamation of character , malicious prosecution ...
I just want my life back ...	fair enough . let's go make a statement .
come on , let loose !	I was just thinking about where I'm gonna stay . I lost the house . it's like waking up from a goddamn nightmare .
you'll get over it . we've got a knockdown , airtight , motherfucker of a lawsuit against Sandra Van Ryan .	just like that ?
just like that ? these people ruined your life , bro .	okay , try me on Sunday . I'm going out to the Everglades on Saturday . you guys can wash the mud off .
where's the hose ? we can set up .	in back of the garage .
aren't you forgetting something ? your coupon . we gotta have it .	jeez , that thing ... Can't you ...
rules are rules , Mr. Lombardo .	all right . I'll have to look for it .
Kelly ...	drop dead ... You know where my mom is trying to get the money to pay you off ? she's trying to break my trust . how do you like that ? I can't touch it until she's dead and she won't give me a dime and now she's trying to break it to pay you ...
how much ?	about six and a half million dollars .
God , you scared the shit out of me . you must be crazy coming here .	of course I'm crazy . ask my mom .
the only way we're gonna blow this now , is if we do it ourselves ...	do it to ourselves ?
we have to stick with the plan .	stick ?
Kelly . is Suzie there ?	yes .
shit . I was afraid of that . she left this garbled message on my machine . can you calm her down ?	why can't you come ...
you know what it takes .	then do it . I need you on this Kelly . do it tonight . we'll figure something out ... Okay ?
I'm here .	okay . I want you to hear this too . we've got to be cool . all of us . people think I'm rich , for Christ's sake . I'm doing what rich guys do . I'm spending my money . it's more suspicious if I sit around doing nothing . now don't let this cop fuck with your minds .
I'm sorry , Kelly . I'm sorry it had to happen like this . she was losing it ...	there was no way . that cop would've gotten her to tell him ... everything . she was weak and dumb ...
hello ?	hello .
Duquette . forget him ...	I can't help it . he gives me the creeps ... I mean why was Suzie so scared of him ? she's not that way . I think he did something ...
yeah , he got her busted for possession ...	I don't know ... I think it was something else ... Suzie says the bust was bullshit ...
and you believe her ?	I don't know . I want to see you ...
Kelly ... Relax . take one of your mom's Valium or something . in another week you get on the plane . it's over . we're rich .	but what if they find out ... God , they'd put you in the gas chamber ...
so if they're tapping your phone , we're dead . stay in the guest house . skip the graduation parties . you'll never see Duquette . okay ? I love you .	okay . I love you too .
that never seemed to worry you at the Glades .	that's not your line .
I love you . now give me the line .	no little girl can ever make me come .
I'm running away .	you think that's wise ?
is that Sam Lombardo ?	hi , Mon .
"which one of your "" bodyguards "" is that ?"	Whichever one I want .
okay , what's the matter ?	you notice my new jumper ?
my friends buy me clothes , so I don't look like trash .	I would hardly say you look like trash .
Kelly . what is it ?	I miss Dad .
Jesus . well , I do too , sometimes ...	no you don't .
I was raped . by Sam Lombardo .	he ... Sam Lombardo ?
you didn't have to fly back -- from -- wherever , for me ...	I'm here to congratulate my friends and their children . I'm leaving again tonight .
don't bother . I'm taking a trip .	where , the mall ?
excuse me ?	you all gonna go down to the Caribbean together ?
the thing about it is , threesomes so rarely work out .	you're out of your mind .
get off my property .	I'm not on your property !
will you calm down . Duquette's gonna come to you just like he did to me . you're gonna have to be ready for him .	yeah , but he can't push you around like he can me . you've got family and they've got clout . with we it's different ... with me ...
yeah , I've got family and they've got clout and now you have me . right ? and Sam . believe me , Suzie , this dickhead's not going to send you anywhere . he's gonna try and rattle your cage , and that's it . stay strong and he can't do shit .	man , I wanna smoke a joint .
I can't believe you called Sam . what's the matter with you ?	I'm scared , that's what . I'm scared there's no one to trust .
you're gonna fuck me over , aren't you ?	oh , for Christ's sake .
you are .	are you retarded , or just brain dead from whiffin' fumes out there in the swamp ...
anybody ever tell you that stuff will rot your brain ?	what brain ?
what are you looking at ?	nothing .
I thought we were goin' to a movie .	I think we just need to get wasted .
I wanna live at the beach someday .	shit .
it's those rocks , up there .	you and Suzie used to come out here together ?
yeah , sometimes . lots of the kids hang out here . you really think something bad happened to Suzie ?	Lombardo ever come out here ?
I say something funny ?	no . but I mean ... just the idea that Mr. Lombardo would ...
way I hear it , he was pretty tight with the kids , one of the guys ...	yeah , but ...
come on . beats study hall , doesn't it ?	no !
thank you , Jimmy .	hey , man , at least in study hail I could meditate .
what about you , Jimbo , you need a ride ?	what ?
a ride . you want one ?	yeah . but I got my bike .
you guess ? did he or didn't he ?	yeah ... okay ... he did
and then what ... he touched you ? did you maybe flirt a little ...	I wanna go home now .
what did you do then ?	shit , what difference does it make ... Nobody's gonna believe me anyway ...
Suzie ! did this man rape you ?	okay ! he did . he pushed me to the floor and he did it to me . now , can I go home ?
he pushed into me ... I couldn't stop him ... it hurt .	I'm sorry ... you said it hurt ? why ?
Ms. Toller ?	I said he did .
Ms. Toller . I'm asking you now , under oath , did Samuel Lonbardo rape you ?	this wasn't my idea .
I'm sorry ?	he was my friend at first . then I got busted ... he didn't even stick up for me . I had to go away to that hellhole . it's like , you're his favorite , then who cares ? you wanna know something ? when Kelly said we should do this , I thought cool , all these big shots screwing me over , like that cop , Duquette . now they're gonna get screwed .
the line I get on this guy , is that he's done half the women in Blue Bay .	not that stuff about her running away , him trying to find her . that's bullshit .
what about witnesses ?	we've got three . guy mowing his yard , couple of kids playing hoops .
are you crazy , Ray ?	"you heard Kelly say "" Sam . "" that was Lombardo on the phone . and you saw the girls ..."
Ray . the conversation on this tape is totally unintelligible . what we have here , is you on the Van Ryan property , without a proper warrant , shooting a porn flick ...	I don't believe I'm hearing this . a month ago you were pulling these two apart at the courthouse . they were acting . they were all acting , from the beginning . and we bought it , hook , line and sinker ... And now they're home free with six million of Sandra Van Ryan's money .
oh , Ray ... no ...	you think this is just about money , about us looking foolish ? question him . you're gonna find a stone cold manipulative psychopath . and those girls are going to wind up dead ...
Kelly's next , Gloria .	get off this Ray , now . if there is any evidence here , it's for Homicide . you get an ID , you call me .
I fucked up . I lost control of the situation , the one thing they train you for ... God , what did I do ?	just tell us what happened .
she bit you ?	bit , scratched . but I had her pinned . she calmed down . I was going to cuff her ... She said she thought she was going to be sick . she asked to use the bathroom .
I told her I was coming with her . she nodded , like she understood . we stood up together .	you didn't cuff her ?
the teeth , were they ...	Suzie Toller's . and that's the only thing saving your sorry ass .
why ?	I think she's acting . I think she set it up to be alone with him because she wanted him to come on to her . I think maybe she's upset that he didn't ...
that doesn't make him a child rapist . there's something else . this girl's had some problems . wrecked a couple of her mom's cars . ran away ...	where's this coming from ?
I want a full-scale investigation .	you know what that will mean for Lombardo .
that bothers you ?	yeah , maybe , a little .
you didn't tell me you were gonna put me on the fucking news .	we need to tape the interview , Suzie . no one will see it but us . now when was this , that Mr. Lombardo gave you the ride ?
he dropped Jimmy off first ?	yeah .
and when he arrived at your house , was anyone there ?	no .
so you were alone .	yes .
did he come in with you ?	I guess .
at that point were you able to fight him off ?	no . he stopped by himself . okay ? that's all . let me go .
he did say something .	what was that ?
I've got that two o'clock in town .	back to the land of grownups .
that would make it about the time of her old man's suicide . you don't think that could explain some erratic behavior ?	all I'm saying is , I think we should go slow here .
it's our job , Gloria .	hunter's making it our job because Sandra Van Ryan's got a bug up his ass . you know that as well as I do . we're gonna trash this guy's life and I keep asking myself if it's really necessary .
same as him . they saw her come . they saw her go . they saw him follow .	still doesn't explain why he couldn't catch up with her . I mean how long does it take to put on a shirt ?
we failed to mention the mower guy's a drunk , that he was after more beer and never really saw Kelly go into the house , so he can't say how long she was in there . same with the kids . they saw her running down the street , but that's it . with no physical evidence , what do we have ? her word against his .	you're telling me you believe the guy ?
you can go up to one of those trees and peel the bark . you know what you get ? more bark . and more bark . there's no core . tree's not good tar anything but sucking up water . and now they can't get rid of them . they've tried poisons . nothing works . they don't die .	yeah , well , Van Ryan got his . I don't imagine he gives a shit now .
the skinny brunette .	this is where she lives . she wants to talk . beats the shit out of me why she would call me at all . I busted her once for possession. she wound up doing about six months at Camp Nine .
you saw the news today ?	Lombardo's settlement ?
think back , before the suit was filed , before the trial . Lombardo had an affair with Sandra , right ? so why not tell us about the affair ? I mean it could be a hell of a motive for Kelly to fabricate her charge in the first place .	maybe Lombardo's attorney was saving the affair for the trial .
I thought of that . then I said , come on , you're Lombardo . your reputation is getting trashed . you want to stop the bleeding . you don't want to sit in jail for three months . unless ...	unless what ?
why ? you ask me , Lombardo had it pretty good already , nice job in a beautiful setting , popular , an active social life . he's gonna put this all on the line for some dicey play like what you're describing ...	the job looks okay to us . but look at it from his point of view . the man's surrounded by wealth and privilege . but for him ... it's just a reminder of what should have been his .
her father didn't leave her squat . the kid's got money in trust from her grandfather , but she can't touch that till her mother dies and Sandra seems to have the idea that Kelly ought to learn the value of a buck .	this one's got you working overtime , hasn't it ?
I flat don't like the guy , glory . he's dirty . and I'll tell you something else . you want to know how old man Lombardo lost his money ? he was fucked out of it by old man Van Ryan , on a little item known as the Salt Creek Land deal . it was after the war . van Ryan set up a corporation to develop swamp land , got investors like Lombardo to put up money , then turned around and got the state to declare the area an ecological preserve , on the sly , of course , but everyone knew it was him . the freeway went to the coast , right where Van Ryan wanted it .	eliminate the competition .
you got it . the rich got richer . while the saps like Lombardo went belly-up in the swamp .	where'd you come up with this stuff , anyway ?
I net a guy in a bar .	which she might have saved , if she hadn't set out to destroy the man's life .
guess I kind of lost it there .	you could say that .
were you ever in a situation where you could see a thing coming and you didn't do what you could to stop it ?	we all have ...
Ray . we don't know anything yet . she could be anywhere ...	I'm gonna take you back to the office . will you put out a call on Suzie's car for me ?
just check out the car .	two kids could've gotten into a fight , lost a couple of teeth .
those are Suzie Toller's teeth .	where's the body ?
the swamp , most likely ... Lombardo's a swamp rat , knows the body will never be found there . but he's made a mistake .	her grandmother said she'd been threatening to run away . and I found the car at the Miami bus terminal .
poor dumb Suzie , she never had a chance .	we don't know that , Ray ...
will you do me one favor ?	Ray , you heard him ...
and if the teeth aren't Suzie's ? you'll give this up ?	if I'm wrong about those teeth -- it's a promise .
I'm tired , Ray . I'm going home .	where's Lombardo ?
he's leaving the country . and I don't give a shit .	the blood type on the rocks matches Suzie's .
it's Homicide's job now , Ray , let' em do it . I'll tell you something else , there's more to this story than you know , Ray ... If Suzie is dead , I think Hunter may be on the right track ...	if old pictures interest you , come back some time , there's quite a collection down in the pagoda . I'll see you get a proper tour .
did you call anyone ? did you call her house to see if she got home ? did you call the Masons ?	no .
Suzie Toller is missing .	how long ?
she didn't cone home last night . we found her car at the bus terminal , but nothing to suggest she bought a ticket .	maybe she used another name .
Ray thinks she was murdered .	I don't know what to say ...
Kelly's file . read it . you're going to find an angry , sexually confused girl who's made threats on her mother's life and a female lover she'd never identify .	Suzie ?
how are you , Kelly ? would you like to take a break for a minute ?	I just want to get it over with . my mom's making me do this . I just want to forget it .
the next thing ... his hand was in my shorts ... you know , from behind . his fingers ... his fingers ...	take your time .
I understand .	"he said something like , "" Do you want it dirty7 "" or something . I tried to turn away , but he pushed me to the floor ."
was there penetration ? did he put himself inside you ?	yes . I said stop . I screamed . I mean that's how it sounded in my head . he hurt me ...
that's okay , Kelly . you're doing fine . but I have to ask you something here . when you say it hurt . was this the first time a man was inside you ?	no . I've done it a couple of times , I mean with guys I dated . but this hurt ... like , he was built ... you know ...
I ... he had my wrists pinned behind me . I remember my hands were cold .'	then what ?
"he kept saying , "" Let it happen , let it happen . "" then he just stopped ."	you mean he withdrew ...
not at first . he was still inside but he wasn't moving or anything ... He said we had this secret . and that now he'd be able to help me ... because we were close ... Something like that . I don't know . it's hard to remember , exactly .	try , Kelly .
Gator can't see what's in front of it for shit . they see out the sides . that one don't even know Walter's arm's in his mouth .	what if something distracts it and it snaps anyway ?
I was wondering if I could ask you a few questions .	about Suzie ?
actually , I was wondering if I might ask you about Ray Duquette .	he used to come around here . he had a thing going with one of the girls over at the Glades .
got sort of hung up on her , from what hear .	she still work there ?
no . not after that night . I don't know what happened . maybe he caught her with some john ... All I know is , the next morning the girl was gone and there was a dead boy ... Indian kid named Davy . used to live down the road there in a wrecked car . him and Suzie were at the Glades that night . it was right after that , Ray got Suzie busted and sent her away . that's what there is to say about Ray Duquette .	was there ever any kind of investigation ...
wasn't enough Van Ryan had to destroy the people who invested here . he got to be old , he and his rich cronies would come down here , hunt and whore , act like assholes . one trip he showed up with this young girl he'd picked up somewhere , gotten her pregnant then dumped her in the swamp . that came with her .	and the child ...
she had it , before she drank herself to death . wasn't exactly a love child ...	Suzie . then you're not her grandmother ...
raised her like she was , but no , Walter's my only child . he was a good boy , till the army took him .	so Suzie and Sandra Van Ryan were half- sisters .
you okay ?	I'm fine . nice TV .
how soon can we get something ?	we can get blood type right away . dental records will take longer . you want DNA , that can take weeks .
Merritt , forensics .	the teeth doin' any talkin' ?
Ray . stop calling . I told you the dental records will take time ...	what about the blood ?
could be hers . types match . could be a lot of other people's too ...	second you get something on those teeth , I want it
not that I'm going to be much good after last night ...	eat a power bar .
is that Sandra Van Ryan's kid ?	Kelly .
she's going to wash your Jeep ?	senior class fund-raising gig . I told' em they could hose down the Jeep . hey , come on . it's for a good cause .
you look pretty .	thanks .
hey , I've got it , I may as well spend it , right ? I've always wanted to live where I could dive for my dinner .	and where might that be ?
I was thinking , Antigua , maybe .	I love Antigua . maybe I'll come visit you .
talk to me Artie .	Kelly Van Ryan ...
... is accusing me of rape . Jimmy told me . apparently I'm the last to know ...	Sam ... I ... Sandra Van Ryan's been on the horn with every member of the school board all day long . she's pushing for suspension ...
all I can tell you Sam , is hang in there . they clear you of this mess , you get reinstated , with back pay ...	that's great . I'll just tell my creditors I'm not a rapist . no problem ... Shit . I can't believe the board's going to act without even hearing my side of it .
in a hurry , are we ?	I was in the middle of a melodramatic exit . it wouldn't really make a statement if I tiptoed out the door ... What are you selling ?
bad news .	people pay good money for that ?
I'm just a messenger .	oh no . no way . I've had all the bad news I can take for one day .
my parents ? what do you mean ?	I'm terrible at this . I blurt . I'm a blurter . your parents ... They ... well ... they exist no further . Skinny-dipping . the Amazon . Piranhas . it wasn't pretty .
you've got the wrong guy . the closest my parents have been to the Amazon is the Brazilian Pavilion at Epcot .	well kid , I'm speaking of ... your biological parents .
how quaint .	it's spring break . I don't want to go to a will reading .
"are you familiar with "" Heaven ? """	I'm seventeen . I know it like the back of my hand .
"your fathered owned the entire "" Heaven "" empire . you own it now . any questions ?"	smashing ! welcome to the family , Ted . you are going to breathe some new life into this place . you are going to set the world on fire ! you are going to ... call me Uncle Billy ? please ?
uh , sure . Uncle Billy .	I have only one concern ...
of course I like girls .	a lot ? I mean , a whole lot ?
as much as possible .	you're sure ?
the parties are held in here when the weather dips below seventy . which is seldom .	seldom ? no kidding ?
ah , in other words , this is the apres-orgy salon ?	indeed it is . during the day , visitors prefer to be outside , au naturel . as it were .
maybe she needs help , Ted . you should be a gentleman .	I ... uh ... I think she's doing fine on her own .
there you are , Ted-baby . everything all right ?	yeah . everything's cool .
you ready for your big coming out party ? everybody's dying to meet you .	just a couple of finishing touches . my parents always said you never get a second chance to make a good first impression .
they said that ? really ? oh , your parents . the Nelson's . right , right . how Midwest . I like that .	truth is , I'm a little nervous .
all those people out there . it's a lot of pressure .	huh ! you laugh in the face of pressure !
I do ?	you are a multi-media magnate . the Tycoon of Tits . the Baron of Bottoms .
you're the Sultan of semen . the Monarch of masturbation . the merchant Prince of lust . you . Ted . are the King of coitus .	me ? the King of coitus ?
the Supreme sovereign of Sexuality .	whoa . but ... that's the thing ... I've never even actually ...
I told you you could do it .	I was like a different person tonight .
you were the new and improved you .	I would have been laughed right out of Xenia .
no one will be laughing at you now , Ted . you can take that to the bank .	it's really going to be strange going home in a couple of days .
you ARE home . but go ahead , finish school , do what you feel you need to do . in the meantime , I'll be your point person here on the magazine .	really ? you'd do that for me ?
I've been very lazy for a long , long time .	you seem like you're anything but lazy , Uncle Billy .
I never finished school myself . never had to . my brother built this empire from nothing but his wife's perky tits and a whole lot of gumption . he gave me a cushy job on a silver platter . I never struggled for a second .	my parents always say hard work builds character .
it's not like I didn't have ideas , I had plenty of ideas . but I never even shared them with your father . never had the guts .	what kind of ideas ?
"well ... for one thing ... I think it's despicable that we exclude so many women that only fit our western notion of "" classic beauty . """	you think we should be more open minded ?
the world is a big , beautiful place . we can open new markets in Africa and Asia . imagine the Dali Lhama reading our magazine .	in other words , our scope is too narrow .
at our press conference tomorrow , I think we should announce our plans to explore the world . not just a few leggy 36D's , with blond hair upstairs and down .	that's perfect .
don't forget to tell them all your qualifications .	I'm Ted Nelson . I guess you already know that part . for two years I've been the editor of the high school paper in Xenia , Ohio . I've won some awards , made a difference . I've always had journalism in my soul . now I know why .
so far , so good . some of them have real Angel potential .	really ? so I'm doing OK ?
my father must've been amazing .	he was in a league of his own .
I never saw anybody turn so many shades of red .	I can't wait to see the pictures .
it was incredible . the light , the crowd , everything .	such enthusiasm . have I told you lately how proud I am of you ?
seriously ? I'm doing all right ?	"you're taking this bull of an empire by the horns , but you're still keeping your small town values . you're not letting all this "" stuff "" spoil you ."
I owe it all to you . without your help I'd be lost .	I wish I knew you years ago , when my brother was alive . I wish he never gave you up .
I'd love to , but I really need to crack the books . final exams are coming up and I've been slacking .	you're right . I should work , too . our first issue together is almost ready to print .
thanks , Uncle Billy . thanks for everything .	you're a great kid . don't you forget it .
yes ?	we've got a huge problem with the magazine , Ted-baby . our readers hate it . hate IT . we need to talk .
I loved my brother . I stood by his wishes to let his son run the company . a son he never knew . a son that he and his wife gave away at birth . a son who was raised in a world quite different from our own . nevertheless , I was there for the lad . I guided him as best I could . but he's only seventeen , with a mind of his own and judgment that is , well , frankly , not a chip off the old block . there is only one clear solution ... And I think we all know what that is--	--PEACHES ! canned peaches !
what are you doing ?	my job . back off , Benedict .
thanks for teaching me an important lesson . what makes a family is love , not blood .	"all is fair in "" Heaven , "" Ted-baby ."
that's right . and guess who's the new King of the unemployment Line .	aw , come on , kid . throw me a bone . I'm your uncle for gosh sakes .
I like you , Ted . you know that . I liked you before you were filthy rich .	thanks , Principal Merkin .
I'll be blunt . I know you can take it .	yes , sir . I'll brace myself .
Ted , you are the best editor this school paper ever had . you don't need to be pandering flesh . it's nonsense . it's beneath you .	you think I ought to just tell them thanks but no thanks ? I don't want your silly billion dollar empire ?
that's a good start , yes . a very good start .	are you kidding ? this magazine is my dream . it's every red-blooded , heterosexual male's dream .
"have you ever even looked at "" Heaven ? """	what kind of sick question is that ? I'll be watching you , young man . your money and power mean nothing here . nothing .
with all due respect to Merk , he doesn't have to read my magazine . but he has no right to stop others . ever hear of the First Amendment ?	we cannot afford free speech if it excises the moral fiber of this community !
honestly , Merk . it's like you were never seventeen and the head of a media empire .	rules are rules .
come on , it's our only senior prom .	deaf ears , Mr. Nelson . I answer to a higher power .
you're crossing the line , Mr. Nelson .	a statue in front of city hall , dedicated to Principal Dick Merkin ?
I'm warning you .	a new pediatric wing at the hospital ? a presidential campaign ? name it . anything .
you kicked us off your turf , Merk . don't rain on our parade .	Mr. Nelson , you disappoint me . first you break our school board rules . then you break the law .
what law , Merk ? having fun ? letting down our hair on prom night ?	our state has a zero tolerance policy for underage drinking .
you called the cops on us ?	alcohol does horrible things to a developing young mind .
what is this ? does everybody know everything I'm about to say or do every freakin' minute of the day ?	no cursing in this house , young man . use the strong vocabulary God gave you .
what about Charlie ? you boys could make it a little adventure .	Charlie , at a will reading ? what did I do to deserve this ?
I'm all right , Mom . I'm not in Siberia , you know .	did you have a nice flight ? are they taking good care of you ?
yeah , I'm doing fine . I have so much to tell you . I don't even know where to begin .	save it , honey . we want to hear every detail when you get back , but we don't want you to run up Mr. Zukerman's phone bill .
well ? surprised ?	what is all this ? when are you coming home ?
just a few tokens of my affection . I'll be back soon , don't worry .	everything is lovely , Ted , but much too expensive .
oh , good lord . are those Neptunes ?	only the best for my mother .
you promise you'll finish school ?	I'll make you very proud .
you don't have to work another day in your lives .	but how would we pay our bills ?
don't you get it ? in one day I earn more interest than the store's entire annual revenue .	oh . goodness .
you're free . you can do anything you ever wanted to do !	like what ?
but who would run the store ?	forget the store . think big .
everything I am is because of you . can you ever forgive me ?	oh , Teddy . we missed you so much .
so , William Randolph . your last big scoop contrasted the popularity of Rice Crispie treats and chocolate Snickerdoodles at the annual bake sale .	that's just one example . my reporting has made a difference .
the school dumpsters used to overflow to the point where the stench was unbearable . my award winning exposé changed all that . the city added an extra weekday trash pick-up .	is it true ? is ignorance bliss ?
"look , I loved "" exposed ! "" and I hate it that you got busted . I know the school paper sucks in comparison , but it's really not THAT BAD ."	don't even tell me you're hot for Miss titty Pom Poms over there .
Christy's a very talented journalist . I see a Pulitzer in her future .	I didn't know they gave them for Best Lip gloss Retention during a Blow Job .
Me-ow .	go ahead . ask her to the prom . get it over with .
I have absolutely no intention--	--Do it . I triple-dog-dare you .
I tried to warn you , William Randolph . she's got stiletto heels hidden in those Keds .	but you triple-dog-dared me .
it's so nice to have friends like you , Christy .	what is it , William Randolph ? your balls need scratching ?
your article sucked .	in what sense ?
"in the sense that there is no "" hidden agenda "" behind a bake sale that raised five hundred dollars for seeing eye dogs ."	ah ha ! it was so well hidden , you didn't even know it was there .
come on , Julie . don't screw up . you have some real talent .	just because someone died and made you king of the publishing world doesn't mean you're even one ounce smarter than you were a week ago .
I'm trying to help .	I'm still better than you . nothing changed except the decimal point in your savings account .
what do you want from me ? I'm trying to be fair . but I can't keep you on staff if you turn every PTA meeting into an Agent Orange cover up .	then I'll write about YOU .
me ?	""" local boy inherits more money than god . "" call me crazy , but I smell human interest ."
different how ? different like a dwarf at a basketball game ? or different like a lesbian in pumps ?	I don't get the distinction .
could everybody else tell you were different , or were you the only one who knew ?	I felt limited . I felt confined . I felt like I was suffocating .
I see . so more like a tight rope Walker who secretly wants to be a trapeze artist .	I guess .
she said peanuts , you cretin .	you never know around here .
don't write that part .	is this an gritty exposé or a candy ass press release ?
write what you want . just try not to make it so obvious that you're crazy about me .	life must be peachy on Planet Ted .
I did my homework . your grandfather was a peach farmer .	my adoptive grandfather . who knows what my biological grandfather did .
undoubtedly an aristocratic bartender of some sort .	considering this is your first time on a private jet , on which you are interviewing the world's most eligible bachelor , you are extremely cavalier .
I bet there are lots and lots of mirrors on Planet Ted .	see ? you're impertinent , rude , sarcastic .
and this is not my first time on a private jet , so quit acting like I'm Rebecca of Sunnybrook Farm .	a little respect would be nice , that's all .
well ? what do you think of her ?	you're so twitterpated you don't even see the miner's hat and the pickax .
why can't you be nice to me ?	you've got enough people kissing your ass .
wow ... you clean up nice .	put your eyeballs back in your head , William Randolph . I'm on assignment . a girl has to fit in .
where are we going ?	to the best hiding place in the world .
I can't believe your dad built this for you .	he didn't . he had it built .
whatever .	"not "" whatever . "" it's two different things ."
he cared enough to want you to have it .	he phoned it in .
I doubt it .	now it makes sense , the whole Neo Bohemian , down with hypocrisy , fight the power crap . you're a poor little rich girl .
the ozone must be fully depleted on Planet Ted .	you think my dad would have been like that if I knew him ? you think he would have bought me a stadium , instead of teaching me how to play ball ?
your dad taught you everything .	I mean my father .
a father is nothing but sperm , Ted . it takes a real man to be a dad .	it's all so complicated .
it's incredibly simple .	I feel like I'm being drawn and quartered . like every part of me is being pushed and pulled and tugged in a different direction .
eventually you'll let go .	and then what ?
then you'll see who's really holding on to you .	you're amazing .
I know .	even when you infuriate me , I still want to kiss you .
but you never do .	if we were a team , we could do anything . I mean , anything .
cut to the chase , William Randolph . your audience is way ahead of you .	in a word : MERK . exposed .
"that's two words . and I'm out of the "" exposed "" business , remember ? I need to graduate . besides , Merk's a boy scout ."	there's gotta be something . we have to dig deeper .
you forget , I dislike YOU at least as much as him .	he shut down your paper ! you're stuck writing articles about swap meets and raffles and PTA brunches !
a good journalist can take lemons and make lemonade . I'm honing my craft .	then you won't mind covering that watermelon seed spitting contest next week ...
that's probably my office .	well ? where the hell are you ?
I got an anonymous tip and an address in Cincinnati .	let's do it .
I don't know . this place seems pretty tame .	you expected whips , chains , Merk being cattle-prodded by some dominatrix in a leather hood ?
at least it's not another 4-H meeting or a Big Brother barbecue .	amen to that .
look at us . it's one o'clock in the morning , on a school night . we're in a smoky nightclub , hoping to catch our principal with some big city tart .	I'm trembling with excitement .
that has more to do with your proximity to me .	my desire betrays me , like goosebumps on my flesh .
I have a bit of a goosebump fetish . not many people know that .	I figured you for more of a hairy armpit guy .
shoes , if you want to know the truth . shoes are my thing .	wearing them ? or humping them ?
my fantasy is a totally naked woman , wearing nothing but a Timex and suede clogs .	that's refreshingly deviant .
what about you ?	I'm very aural .
tell me more .	sounds , voices , music , humming . all of it can turn me on , or off , like a switch .
I see .	I had a Portuguese boyfriend who could read the phone book and melt me .
"a Portuguese boyfriend . sounds very "" Cosmo . """	you live and learn . I realized the most important thing to me , above all , is trust .
turned out to be a scoundrel , eh ? I saw that one coming .	you lose trust in someone and it's over , done , gone , forever .
do you trust me , Julie ?	not a chance .
come on .	trust is something you earn , over time . you don't just inherit it overnight like a gazillion dollar empire .
I want you to trust me .	maybe someday .
Julie , I'll tell you something that is the god's honest truth . I've seen a lot of really beautiful girls . I mean a lot . but none of them make me feel like you do .	that's hard to believe .
"I have to be honest with you , Ted . I really despise "" The Girls of Xenia . """	I know , their small town mentality can be maddening .
I mean your pictorial . it bothers me , profoundly .	aw Julie , it's my job . it's like being a doctor .
you're telling me you don't get aroused by a roomful of naked breasts .	you've seen one naked breast , you've seem them all .
"which explains the continued success of "" Heaven "" for how many decades ?"	you're quick . I like that .
you think you're working with chimps here ?	the thing is , I made a commitment . I said I'd do it and I have to keep my word .
Julie , wow . I was afraid you left . I was afraid I'd never see you again .	I'm not going anywhere , Ted . you're the one with the champagne wishes and caviar dreams .
very ambitious . I like that .	the thing is , I'll need a first mate .
"I graduated from college . did great , summa cum laude and all . and I'm about to launch a brand new magazine called "" exposed ! "" an homage to Miss Julie Conroy of Xenia , Ohio ."	I know where you can find an excellent editor-in-chief .
yellow pages ?	let your fingers do the walking .
they're playing our song . dare I ask for this dance ?	you better .
Mom , Dad . meatloaf has come to represent all that Ted hates about his mediocre life and the world we live in . he's what you'd call clinically bummed .	why can't we have pot roast or stroganoff or even a little London broil ? I mean , for god's sake , we own a grocery store !
James , what are you doing here ?	you can call me Jimmy again . Sheryl Petersen said James sounds too pretentious .
Sheryl Petersen is , what , nine years old , what does she know ?	she knew exactly where you were staying , which you neglected to tell me , your own brother .
impressive . this is bigger than our whole house .	most places are , Jimmy .
they say money can't buy happiness but this is a reasonably good facsimile .	so , what brings you here at his hour ?
my new bike .	very funny .
I came to ask permission to take custody of your room .	my room ?
better view , more spacious , new carpet . it's a no-brainer .	it's not up to me .
Mom and Dad said it's yours . they seem to think you're coming home .	you can have it , then . I'm not going back there .
if you could just sign right there .	you want it in writing ?
just a formality .	that's it ? I mean , you don't want to order room service or anything ? we could play games and watch movies and stuff .
are you kidding ? Mom and Dad discover I'm gone and I'll be doing hard time .	are they okay ?
aside from the fact that Mom's eyes are nearly swollen shut from crying and Dad spends all his time under the car trying to fix stuff that isn't broken , things couldn't be better .	I miss them , too .
you can't come back . that is , you can , but your things will be in the room you currently think of as mine .	you're a peach .
funny you should say that . my Grandfather was a peach farmer .	he was my Grandfather , too .
I meant biologically .	that's a crappy thing to say .
I didn't forget .	"you ever look down on them again and call them "" grocers "" like it's a dirty word , and you'll be sucking your filet mignon through a straw for six to eight weeks . got it ?"
great .	from my wise , albeit youthful , vantage point , the world is your oyster . you scored big .
how are the hometown folks treating you , back in Xenia ?	well , Jay . they've been exceptionally supportive .
are they hitting you up for donations ? asking you to sponsor the local quilting bee ?	I'm no stranger to the notion of philanthropy . Andrew Carnegie has long been one of my idols .
"what about the future ? you planning to rock the boat at all ? stir things up in "" Heaven ? """	"matter of fact , Jay , my uncle and I are planning to rethink the magazine . to expand the traditional western notions of "" beauty . """
no problem , consider it done . I had this idea of shooting on location . outdoors , you know ? maybe at some famous Xenia landmarks . you think that would be a problem ?	we'll send you the release forms , Ted . our staffers will help in any way they can .
it's a little more serious than that , Bill . the stockholders have requested a meeting . they want our guarantee that this will never happen again . some of them are even calling for Ted's resignation .	look , the girls of Xenia are gorgeous , you'll see . next month we'll be back to normal .
your parents never wanted to interfere with your life , Ted . they knew your Mom and Dad loved you very much . they knew they did the right thing . but that doesn't mean they didn't watch you and miss you , from afar .	you mean they knew who I was ?
I wondered about them , for so many years . I wondered if I looked like them , acted like them . I wondered why they gave me up .	"giving you up was the most unselfish thing they ever did . when they founded "" Heaven , "" they wished they could take you back but it was too late . all they could do was build the empire , knowing that someday it would all be yours ."
my legacy .	your parents would be crushed to think you weren't happy with it .
they're not my parents , Helen . my parents are back in Xenia and I hurt them very much .	I understand .
"and the girl I love , she hates "" Heaven . "" if I keep it , she'll never respect me ."	but how can you respect yourself if you don't ?
but if you're watching this , then it means we bit the dust .	but don't worry ... we'll be in heaven . the REAL heaven , I mean . not that heaven is an actual place , but more like a state of being . or not being . who knows . maybe we know now .
if you're anything like yours truly , then you probably figure we didn't want you when you were born , so who cares if we're dead ? am I right ?	but we did want you . it's just that you don't always get to keep what you want . we knew you needed a real mom and dad .
we had no idea the nudie magazine we started in the garage would turn into all this .	can you believe that was me ?
before we knew it , we created the most popular men's magazine in the entire nation . the rest is history .	so here we are . dead . but we never want you to want for anything . that is , we want you to have everything .
I-I don't have the keys .	they're in the ignition , silly .
you do know how to drive ?	I don't have much experience with a ... uh ... stick .
now release the brake . and slide the stick into first gear .	got it .
the first time can be awkward . you just have to get on and try again .	I don't even know if I should be doing this . it's a very expensive car .
it's your car . these are all your cars .	some of them have to be automatics .
"your father liked shifting . he said it brought him closer to the engine . "" like a woman , purring with ecstasy . """	I'm Ted , by the way . I think I forgot to say that .
I know . I'm Ginger . Miss April .	the one with the horses .
that's me .	I almost didn't recognize you without ... you know ... that stallion between ... your ... uh ... legs .
hey , Ted . wanna go shopping ?	shopping , really ? I should tell my friend .
don't worry . he found the chocolate room .	hi ho , Silver .
who exactly ARE you ?	what do you mean ? I'm Ted Nelson .
or do you have a taste for the good life , Ted ? it's in your blood .	I always knew there was more . I felt it .
Teddy ? I was thinking .	hmmm ?
after graduation ... maybe we could go away together ?	whatever you want .
Ted ! do something !	what do you want me to do ?
this is humiliating . we're being ejected from a prom !	hang in there , I'll think of something .
well ?	I guess ... I don't know ... I guess we should leave if we're not wanted .
we understand your disappointment , Teddy . Christy is a pretty , sexy , provocative , voluptuous ... We ... uh ... we understand your disappointment .	it's my private business ! mine !
I remember spring break of my senior year . seems like a lifetime ago .	Dad , please .
remember how you struggled through that whole facts of life talk and then found out I knew more than you ?	you're way ahead of me again ?
it was the year of the rhizopus rot . Grandpa almost lost the farm . you sacrificed your dream to go to the prize hog festival . and in the end you saved the peaches and you didn't have to slaughter your sow .	the lesson being ?
sometimes you have to do stuff you don't want to do . it's all part of growing up . and it usually works out peachy in the end .	I'm getting so good at this .
you guys are my parents .	of course we are .
they didn't want me when I was born . why should I care ...	son .
well , why should I ?	they had a rough life . your father was a bouncer . your mother was , well , a two-bit stripper . there was no place for a baby .
I guess .	they did do one great thing . they gave us our boy .
yeah .	be a sport . how bad could spring break in Los Angeles be ?
I guess we could go to Disneyland or something .	think of it as a rite of passage to manhood .
"like one of those "" National Geographic "" specials with the topless chicks ?"	whatever helps you cope .
I guess it's better than having tribal patterns carved in my face .	there ya go . always remember , focus on the peach ...
Ted , it's your dad . I have a question for you . I don't know how to put it tactfully . you know I'm lousy with words .	just say it , Dad .
I know they were simple people , but did this trip help your college fund at all ?	Dad , let's just say I can buy anything I want in the whole bookstore . including the bookstore .
finally , some gratitude .	we're grateful , Ted . it's not that . those craftsman tools ... they're a dream come true .
but those are our dreams , son . we have to make them come true .	consider me your fairy godfather , except without the fairy part . no more mealy apples and bruised bananas , ever , for the rest of your lives .
it's okay . you need me ?	your mom said you've been ignoring your chores .
I paid off the mortgage ! I ordered that Winnebago you always wanted ! now you're ashamed of me ?	you ordered a Winnebago ?
that is your dream , not mine . my dream is so far beyond anything YOU PEOPLE could even imagine .	watch your tone , mister .
shut your pie hole , Jimmy .	I will not have my boys arguing .
we have a truckload of strawberries arriving on Tuesday morning .	we own a small family grocery store .
we can't accept it . it's much too expensive . right , dear ?	of course , dumpling . its very nice of Ted but ...
sweetheart , what is it ?	I always wanted craftsman tools . he even got me the limited edition Buckeye colors .
we wanted you and Jimmy to have it someday . something real and honest .	we love our lives just the way they are .
you have to understand . this was a big shock , for all of us . one minute you're our little boy , of whom we could not be more proud . the next minute you're the owner of this whole pornographic empire .	but that doesn't make you the boss of everything , son .
"we're not ashamed of you , Teddy . we don't approve of the magazine or the models or the so-called "" flesh parties "" you attend . but we can get past all that ."	we miss you . we miss our son .
we think you should give up the magazine . sell it . let someone else run it . whatever it takes .	we want you to go to college , find a career you love , marry a nice girl from a nice family , and live happily ever after .
wouldn't it be awesome if we were about to say the exact same thing ?	from your lips , to God's ears .
ladies first . I insist .	well . the prom's coming up .
yeah ?	and I was wondering .
yeah ?	if you don't have ... I mean ...
Teddy ? would you please please please take me to the prom ?	shut UP ! are you serious ? of course I will ... of course .
Ted , have you lost your mind ?	you like me . I like you . I guess it's pretty obvious to everyone .
I don't LIKE you . we're JUST friends .	but that smile .
oh , Ted , duh . I smile at everyone since I got my braces off .	so you'll think about it ?
so that's a maybe ?	the answer is NEVER , Ted , NEVER . except maybe in your dreams .
great jacket , Teddy Bear .	yeah ? you like ?
"Christy ? you want to be in "" Heaven ? """	I turned eighteen over spring break . I'm eligible .
I thought I'd be nervous , but you sure know how to make a girl feel relaxed , Teddy Bear .	I do ? I mean , yeah , I do .
I have to admit , I am so totally turned on . we should do it . now .	do it ?
you know ... take the pictures ?	I remember the first time you walked into Mrs. Temple's class in 2nd grade . blue gingham dress . blond ponytail .
which you pulled , hard !	"that was code for "" I like you . """
I miss those days , when schoolyard sexual harassment was without consequence .	things change . now I'm taking off my clothes ... all by myself .
well ?	you have changed since second grade .
I mean , what do you think ?	you expect me to think at a time like this ? there isn't a drop of blood in my brain .
I was always too shy to admit how much I liked you .	come on , I was hamburger . you were porterhouse .
maybe on the outside . but inside , deep down , I've always been dripping with special sauces . are you hungry ?	God , you are so hot .
what gives , Don Corleone ?	we reinvented ourselves .
new Hushpuppies don't make a new man .	you've obviously never had your dogs nestled in thousand dollar Italian loafers .
that explains the emptiness that haunts me .	jealousy is so unattractive .
not bad for a hack . he has a future in yellow journalism .	he kicked major ass and you know it .
"naked girls , wild sex , video games . no wonder it's called "" Heaven . """	this is a fun place ... but we don't usually come here until after the orgies .
never say never .	oh , god . look . look .
let me get this straight ...	if it isn't straight by now , son , you probably should see a doctor .
these are real , live women ?	we don't generally feature blow-up dolls in our magazine . but hey , if you think there's a market for it .
come on , bro . spare yourself the humiliation , the degradation ...	you and your pep talks .
don't get me wrong . we can salivate over all the Christy Malones of our lives . wishing we could devour them like melt-in-your-mouth filet mignon . but we're strictly hamburger guys . ground chuck , sixty eight percent lean , is about the best we can hope for .	that's Charlie . my best friend . he's into beef analogies , partly because he's a butcher's son , and partly because , well , he's just into beef analogies . what can I say ? he's also a photographer ...
I genuinely think she wants me . I feel a vibe .	that vibe is from your wrist , pal . you've been over-tenderizing your meat , again .
see ? did you see that ?	she smiles at everyone , Ted . she's like a newborn with gas .
"the only chick more untouchable than Christy Malone is Miss April . "" hi , my name's Ginger . I love tofu burgers , rainy nights , and riding bareback . my biggest turn-off is cell phones during sex . "" here's a tip : set it on VIBRATE , honey , and don't be stingy with the lube . don't knock it till you tried it ."	were you always this sick ?
one thing for sure , Christy Malone ain't lookin THAT good naked .	someday , I'll find out .
you have a better chance of being hit by a Mack truck with a refrigerated cargo bed full of sirloin tip .	I defy your hamburger theory of life , and all of the unfulfilled hopes and dreams it represents .
that's crazy talk .	I defy any and all limits .
don't do it , Ted . don't do it .	any time , any day , a man can completely reinvent himself .
think about it ... Long tunnel , bright lights , it's full of vaginal symbolism .	poor Freud , turning in his grave .
seriously , it's like we're being reborn . we really could reinvent ourselves here , just like you said . nobody knows about your massive humiliation .	nobody knows about your mental retardation .
nobody knows about your constant masturbation .	and nobody knows you're a virgin ! aw , who are we kidding ...
what are the odds of there being ANOTHER Ted Nelson on our flight ?	Astronomical .
who the hell was your father ?	well , Dad said ...
... A bouncer ? are you serious ?	maybe he got promoted .
this is the life , baby . we get ourselves some tail and we're talking spring BREAK !	cut it out , before you break something !
don't you know anything about limo etiquette ? everything in here is included for our pleasure .	wait a second , I thought we were hamburger guys .
I can't believe that's your mother . we're talking babe-a-licious chub fest , right here in the 501's .	perv .
this is like my every wet dream come true . I don't even care that you're here , too , bro .	be cool . fake it if you have to .
this isn't some 80's porno film , you dip shit . there are no wild sex orgies .	oh . well . maybe not yet .
I'd kiss your mother with this mouth . I mean , if she wasn't , you know ...	so far away ? in Xenia ?
check this out . hurry !	I better go , Dad .
hurry .	what is it now ?
check it out !	don't tell me . another vision of incomparable beauty ?
beauty ? no . we're talking goddess .	I get it now . you and me . we're dead .
dead ?	our plane crashed . in the Grand Canyon . a big fiery explosion . we never made it to L.A. They needed dental records to identify us . and this place . this . actually . is . heaven .
then there must be a whole room , made completely of chocolate .	and some really fast cars .
don't be such a pansy . all of this is yours .	it's a lot to digest . imagine how you'd feel .
I'd feel like staying up all night ! forever ! or at least till I got the lay of the land , SO TO speak .	I feel like I'm entering a forbidden tomb ...
oh , how inappropriate is that !	take a whiff of heaven .
how would you like it if I did that to your mother's panties ?	I'd call you a sick , twisted fuck . but this is different . she wasn't your mother mother--
a couple of boys fighting over a pair of red silk panties is nothing compared to what he's seen .	yeah , he's probably been serving cocktails , SO TO speak , at the orgies .
you're late , bro !	sorry . Ginger got a little , you know , enthusiastic .
you'll never believe who's in there .	it better not be my Aunt Trudy .
I feel like I've just been hit by a Mack truck .	with a refrigerated cargo bed full of sirloin tip .
I thought I loved her .	chicks are like buses . if you miss one , don't sweat it . there's another coming' round the corner .
hell yes , all hundred and seventeen of' em !	no , leave one . somebody's grandmother might want one .
and while you're at it , I'll take ten dozen of those puppies with the springy heads .	I love those springy head puppies !
get them together .	brilliant ! Molly , give me all you've got . for Merk .
holy stinkers , what were you thinking ?	we wanted to challenge the notions of classic beauty . we wanted to showcase women throughout the world .
you got everything you ever wanted .	except the girl . the only one that really mattered .
Dr STECKLER ?	yes ... ?
dead ?	or was it , she wished he was dead - that's it - I believe he left the country with another woman - all rather sordid .
no - she isn't in any trouble is she ?	oh no sir - just making some enquiries ... Just tell her that INSPECTOR Taylor called on you - she'll understand
I shouldn't really - I'm not your surgeon ...	who said anything about surgery ... It'll only take a moment .
sugar ?	yes - one please .
angel ...	yes , sorry - He's here to make sure that you are alright
I'm really very sorry - I was banking on this coming through , because it's only five minutes from my surgery ...	surgery ? are you a doctor ?
I'm sorry , I didn't mean to shout ...	don't worry about it -
you're a novelist - why didn't you tell me ?	and not just any novelist - a great novelist - it was an impressive piece of work Ellen ...
her husband left her	oh ...
I thought it was you - how are you ?	I'm good - I was just making a delivery near here , so I thought I would see if you were about ...
that's good	I'd really like it if you would come round some time - Then I could cook you a meal - what do you say ...
yes , that would be nice - I'll call round some time ...	good - I've got to dash - Say that I said hello to Ellen for me would you ...
it's been what , three years ?	what's this all about ?
what brings the rats out of the sewers ?	I'm here about the so called disappearance of your husband - It's best if we let old bones lie . know what I mean ? I'm working on the white angel case now - and I've got to check all known murderers or suspected murderers for the last five years ... And that means you ... So where were you last Thursday afternoon around five ...
you think I'm the white angel ?	it did give me a chance to meet you again Ellen - It's all routine you understand ... So where were you ?
at home alone - where were you ?	as it happens , I was at home alone - maybe we could solve each others problems ?
get out ...	I'd watch her mate - she has thing for men - they disappear near her .
I think you had better leave	I'm sorry , I couldn't - when is she due ?
well , what do you think ?	I don't know - it's your house Ellen
yes - but you live here too - If it were your house ?	I think he's fine - I don't know why you have this thing about men - it would be nice to have a guy in the house for a change - I don't think he would hurt a fly .
what's wrong with you ?	I would prefer it if you kept away from Leslie
what ?	you heard me - keep away from him
you don't own him you know - you can't tell me not to see him !	yes I can ...
I want you out now	leave ! ? who the hell do you think you are ?
what happened ?	I had an accident - I fell down stairs ...
is Leslie here ?	no he had to - he's just - he's out ...
it doesn't mention' females only'	I really don't know what to say
oh - Tell me Ellen , I can call you Ellen ?	sure ...
I lost the touch	the touch ?
do you take sugar ?	yes , two please . I'm sorry , I didn't mean to pry , it's just that I really loved your book
I'm sorry ?	what's with all the locks - and hammering
it says in the contract I can have a lock fitted - is there a problem Angela ?	my names isn't Angela ...
yes - I'm sorry Ellen ...	don't worry - Is that my hammer Well Just make sure that it's put back in the garage ...
if you want any - there's some left in the kitchen	I think I will pass ...
sugar ?	yes , one and a half please .
so what do you do ?	I'm a dentist
and how long have you been a dentist ?	oh , about six years since I graduated
and how many people have you killed ?	I don't know
you don't know ?	no - the police say I've killed fourteen - but I've not - I've killed many more . it amazes me how they just haven't found the bodies . what is society coming to when people just don't get missed . I agree , some of them are well hidden - I probably couldn't even show you where I put them - one girl , number eight I think the press called it - she wasn't even mine - I don't know who did it but I didn't
where do you kill them ...	oh anywhere - whenever I needed to - Do you know how easy it is to take them ? you just pick up a hiker , or someone off the streets - they believe so easily you know ,' Look , I have something to show you' I would say - and that would be it . one girl , I think her name is Debbie - she had broken down on the motorway , and I offered to take her to a service station to call for a tow truck - She just got in and I drove away . when I pulled into the layby and took out my knife - she just froze , and said - what do you want ? - I said , You know what I want . - But she didn't . getting rid of the bodies is just as easy - the first I cut up , put in bags with bricks in , and tossed them off Eldridge Bridge in broad daylight . the real problem with my work is the blood - there is so much of it - and it all spurts out so fast - like a fountain . it made such a mess of
my car I stopped working from my car . she could have stopped me you know - If she really wanted too . that is the difference between the confusion of humanity and the purity of the beast - If a dog attacked you - you could easily kill it without any damage to yourself - Why then do people get bitten by dogs - savaged ? why ?	I don't know
because a dog will attack with a ferocity and force that we poses , but centuries of social contamination has run it out of us - that is what sets us aside from the purity of the beasts ... Society is rotting - men who once were strong and kept everything working are getting soft - women are making them soft - by the time a pretty girl has reached twenty - she has had three lifetimes worth of fun and attention- so she doesn't deserve any more -	didn't DEBBIE deserve anymore ?
no she didn't ...	what did you do with her ?
you know everyone accuses me of being sick - the press , the TV - but I'm not you know - they are - I don't watch it for entertainment every night - I don't sit and watch it whilst eating my dinner - they all say , how could he cut her up ? she was dead - I can't hurt something dead - And all this whilst they slobber down their processed beef burgers by the dozen - I couldn't eat one of those burgers , you don't know what has gone in them !	the press think that the white angel is a woman - why is that ? do you dress up Leslie ?
I don't want to talk about it -	OK , the press call you the white angle because you only kill girls wearing white - why white - white clothes , blonde hair ...
I don't know ...	is' their' colour an expression of their inner self ? by that I mean , extroverts wear bright colours - so what are people who wear white ?
I don't know ...	is white an expression of innocence ? do you crave innocence Leslie ?
let me ask you , why do you wear black Ellen Carter ? what are you running from ?	do you feel sorry for the girls you have killed
why should I feel sorry - they're dead .	how long have you been watching me ?
I have something I have to show you ...	tell me about your wife ...
my wife My wife was the only one who really deserved it . Leslie do this . Leslie do that . Leslie it's your fault ... She used to tell me what to wear , where to go , what to do - she mothered me ...	then why did you marry her -
it seemed like a good idea at the time - why did you marry your husband .	what didn't you like about her ?
you are the first person I have ever told any of this to . we are birds of a feather Ellen ... we're in the same league	I don't think so ... This isn't a game you know ... There aren't points or leagues . sure I killed my husband - but I am no killer .
you've killed but you're not a killer	that's right ... Don't ever think that you and I are the same - we're not even remotely similar . I did what I had to do for myself , for my own self preservation - not to live out some bizarre role playing fantasy . my husband was sick -
why should I ?	why not ? please - it would help me
and how did it feel to be rid of him	wonderful - like a great release - He was a malignant cancer and I had to remove him - the world is better without him
my mother ... ? I never knew my real MOTHER - I was adopted	tell me about your adopted MOTHER
no ... I didn't do it ... I wish I had but I didn't . I was beaten to it . Stephanie became my mother .	Stephanie ?
my sister - My adopted sister -	did Stephanie kill your MOTHER ?
Stephanie loved me - she got some insurance money and took legal custody of me - she was just old enough . we had a ball for years - we could do anything , anywhere , anyhow ... And we did ... We would play games - she would be the executioner and I would be the convict - She would strap me into the arm chair and pretend to electrocute me ...	what was your relationship with Stephanie ?
what ?	I know this sounds insane Ellen , but ... telling you all of this , writing the book ... It feels good . don't get me wrong - I feel like a weight is being lifted from my shoulders ... When I tell you what I have done - I can't believe it is me ... yet I know it was . this is like a purging for me ...
psychiatrists would say that you are confronting your demons	demons ... This wouldn't have been possible without you ... You have given me incentive Ellen - I can see clearer now ...
what's wrong ?	nothing could be better ...
what's wrong ?	I am ashamed of what I have done Ellen . when I read what you had written it made me think - look into myself - I haven't dared look into myself for a long time - I have stopped Ellen , I can't carry on - I won't carry on . all I want is to start a new life - I want a second chance ... You are good to me - you don't condescend , you're intelligent , and very beautiful ...
what is it ?	open it ...
you want me to wear white for you ? you must be madder than I thought ...	but Ellen , I told you I have stopped ...
where are you going ?	out - I may be some time
we've got nothing to talk about	Leslie I'm sorry - I - I didn't know what to think
I thought we had a relationship built on trust - and you just slap me in the face ...	I am sorry ...
Leslie ? is that good enough ?	yes - I suppose so ...
Ellen , would you like a cup - there's plenty in the pot	no thanks -
first finish your tea ...	he doesn't need to ...
why did you let him in ?	what was I supposed to do ?
I don't like sugar	there isn't that much - you didn't even taste it - What's wrong - don't you like my tea ?
it's not that - I just don't want any sugar	why whats wrong with the sugar -
I haven't been using it recently Leslie	crap ! - I wish I had taken a photo of your face when I gave some to that detective - What's wrong Ellen - you look pale - maybe you have been eating the wrong kind of foods lately - it could be food poisoning ?
whats wrong ... what have I done wrong ?	nothing Leslie - I just think we should wait ...
I loved you Ellen - why did you do this ?	it's what you would do to me
don't you want me now Leslie	no - I'll have you after
you see , I am writing this article for chic magazine	chic magazine ?
when could I look round ?	well , if you could come sometime just before we close , then I could show you everything and then we could go for a drink to discuss the finer points ...
that's very kind of you Mr GRIFFITHS ... ?	Brian ...
its cramped in here isn't it Brian	yes it is ...
tell me Brian , what would happen if the client lost the key ?	then we would have to call in our locksmith to break the lock
so there is only one key ...	that's right ...
and it can't be forged ?	I didn't say that - I'm sure it could be , but our clients must sign in first , checking signatures , and a photo ident - we had a nasty theft two years ago and we've been very strict since then .
yes , I'm sure you could - but I can't risk you loosing your job	no -it's no problem - I do it all the time
all the time ?	no - not all the time - I mean
hello Mrs STECKLER - we haven't seen you for a long time	no - I've been abroad for a long time ...
I shouldn't say this - but you really remind me of someone I know	oh really - you must remember me from when I was a regular customer .
I wasn't a manager here then Mrs STECKLER - don't you remember ?	I'm terribly sorry - I have a bad memory ...
this must be one of the old keys -	yes - I have had it for years .
which do you think is her best shot ...	the one on the left - definitely ...
don't give me shit - what do you want ?	I've got a tenant coming over later - can I take the afternoon off ?
that's not technically accurate - SIMPSONS murders weren't sexually motivated .	you know that circulation is down for three months in a row .
I heard something like that	then it's going to be' I killed for sex' ... Listen darling , why won't you let us use your real name for the features - if people knew that it was the Ellen Carter writing the features and not just some pseudonym - then we might shift more units . you haven't written anything in four years darling - I know you need this job - and if circulation keeps dropping , there's not going to be a magazine for you to write for ...
oh MY GAWD !	I'm sorry - I didn't think
I thought you were someone else	well I'm glad I'm not them - what are you doing here so late ? come to that , what the hell have you got that for ?
I thought someone was following me - I - er - I just needed my computer and some things ... Listen , I'd like to work from home for a few weeks - is that OK ?	why don't you take a few weeks off - you're due some holiday time .
sounds good - thank you	don't mention it - now can I get back to my accounts , or do you want to fillet me ?
we'd better get to work on the papers .	papers ... ?
standard for a Mayfair marriage . Rowan - there is a codicil concerning the Mayfair assets . they must be ... aahhh ... held separate from the other party ... Michael that is it's in the will - for centuries . tradition enjoins , Rowan. of course , future earnings from your practice will not fall into -	I've decided not to open a practice here I want to set up a research clinic . for infant genetic disorder .
that's new territory for us ... but yes , we can look into that . explore shelter possibilities , funding bodies. we could -	no tax shelters . no funding . I want to fund the clinic - exclusively . the Diedre Mayfair Research Clinic . I'd like to find an existing building and move in immediately - while we draw up plans for new construction .
that would mean liquidating sizable amounts of cash .	I plan on liquidating almost evetything .
Rowan Mayfair .	Sut McKinley . marry me .
I thought you were almost engaged , Stu ... ?	you really love this guy ... ?
he's got great hands .	hey - I love gloves- I look really great in gloves .
I thought it was' whistle while you work .	is that a crack about our singing ... ?
Mikey - pregnant women get crazy you know that . I mean - hell , they're all crazy anyway - right ... ?	comes running out the front door - down the walk to them . Michael seems to pull inside himself . cool . aloof .
sooner Or later you're gonna run out of things to change . you always do .	I just - hate it when they're - finished .
go home , Stu I'll call you .	bullshit ! let me in ! Mikey - there are people who can help figure this ont .
on which planet ... ?	you can't just -
well , Normie - you won't have to worry about this one being finished for a lonnnnng time . how are the hands ... ?	the guy I told you about - Aaron ... ? he says I can learn to control them . that I could lose the gloves at some point .
&apos; leave bees be - and the bees be nice .' didn't your father ever teach you that ... ?	that's a wasp . fuckers'll sting a tree if they're bored- so - where is she ... ?
wow ...	if you like that type .
I'm getting --- left behind .	left behind ... ? this about Rowan ... ?
a few hours and I'll be wasting away in Margaritaville . oh , sweet decadance .	just don't fall off any ladders .
I'm glad you're around to say it .	my jury's still out on that ,
do they keep everything' out' ... ?	as far as touching things , yes . but the vision - that keeps pouring into my head- It won't go away God - if I could just understand it .
what do you see ... ?	nothing . absolutely nothing-
just one . the bar's closed .	the one time I want it to work ...
you know - doors and keyholes are common signposts in out-of-body -	you're not gonna give me the textbook analysia , are you doctor ... ? my vision was just the chemical reaction of an oxygen-starved brain - and nobody -
harder ...	Rowan ...
harder !	like this ... ? like THIS ... ? !
you're very --- different .	I'll bet you say that to all the women who bring you back to life and then seduce you .
what else did you see- Michael ... ?	what're you - a mindreader ... ? who was the man on the kitchen floor . ~ . ?
my uncle . Graham . he and my Aunt , Ellie raised me . he - he - had a stroke- Just before Ellie died - of cancer . last year .	you knelt there , helpless- You couldn't save him . there was so such anger in you- . death infuriates you ...
it's unbelievable that you can do that .	it - it feels like - like I'm being filled up. crowded out of myself . like I'm fading away-
my mother and I used to take long walks and make up stories about the houses and the people who lived inside . the Queen's house-. the gangster's house-. the clown's house- Like that .	and whose houses do you design ... ?
oh . the Green underwater Ghost's ... The Man With The Eyes In His hands ...	you still feel that crazy ... ?
I was born , in New Orleans , too-	really ... ? your family there ... ?
Nope- My father died before I was born . my mother died in childbirth . El1ie was my only blood relation. so she brought me here ... the day after I was born .	too much ... too fast ... ?
he's very pleased with your response to the surroundings .	he fools around with his patients too .
you touched him --- and saw him ... ? what was he doinging . kinky ... ?	it's come to that , huh ... ? three weeks - and you need a psychic skin flick to perk up our sex life ... ?
Ms. yin , and Mr. yang Aha !	Y-U-H-E-E-Y-A-H . Yu-hee-yah ... ? no way , busters use it in a sentence .
why don't you let at do that ... ?	just sit there and soak up the vitamin D.
doctor's orders- - - ?	Captain's orders .
all I meant was -	you don't know what you meant - because you don't know me .
Christ , Michael - what the hell are we doing ... ? we don't even know -	is this the part where you try and talk yourself out of how good this is ... ?
I'm serious . you don't -	let's see ... Next you tell me all the terrible things about you - and prove that we're doomed to fail - right ... ? you hate kittens and puppies , you've drivin all your lovers to suicide --and those mysterious deaths at the hospital were really -
stop it .	you stop it. you're loving , and gentel .. You're the most remarkable woman I've ever met --- so stop telling me I don't know what I feel just cause you're scared . cause it won't work .
seems more like a year than a month .	Michael - this place is increadible . you - you're brilliant ... The things you created ...
I called Dr. Styles at the neurological Institute In L.A. , remember ... ? he said he'd see you . he was intrigned .	God knows , I'm intriguing .
Michael , do you want to wear those for the rest of your life ... ?	
hello ... ?	Michael ! Jesus I've been trying -
Rowan ... ?	listen . last night - oh Christ , this' 1l take forever to explain . God , Michael ...
what's wrong .. ?	Michael - I have to go - to New Orleans . I'll - I'll call yati when I -
what about you coming down here ... ?	go to LAX and get on a flight to New Orleans . go to the Ponchartrain Hotel and wait for me . I'll call you there .
wait a minute . Rowan - what is going on ... ?	goodbye , Michael . I love you .
you know ... ?	I know . it's not possible --- but I know .
she - she said I - I was a ---	- a witch .
it could've been a tornado - or a - a hurricane . maybe -	Michael - I saw him ! twice ! Carlotta said I --- killed Graham - with - with my anger .
Ro - you can't really believe that . nobody can murder someone with their feelings . I mean --- that's CRAZY .	is it more or less crazy than dying and coming back to life with hands that can see ... ? God , Michael --- what am I ... ?
c'mon . let's go to the ho---	he's in there ! or are you out for a stroll in the garden ... ? ! where are you , goddamnit ... ? !
even if it's all true - that doesn't make you a witch ! it's 1992 , Rowan !	but it scares the hell out of you , doesn't it . Michael ... ?
stop looking at me like that ! I'm not some siren chanting to the moon . and my life is not a cosmic whim ! I am in charge of my life - - and I want to stay . everything that was taken from me is here , Michael . all these years , she was there without me . helpless . I should have been here .	Rowan ... Think of what's in that book . think of last night !
yes . I love you . very much .	I've come home , Michae1 , for the first time . I want to stay here - with you .
it'd take mounths ... and cost a fortune .	I'm soon to be a very wealthy witch .

I'll bet she had a wonderful smile .	let's see .
you sure ... ?	it's the next best thing to being there' - right ... ?
everyone - this is Michael curry .	hello ..
I'm wondering why the hell he hasn't shown up .	he can't hurt us , Michael . it's us - our love . he can't find a crack in it . he can't find a way in .
maybe he's just - waiting ...	if we married , we'd shut him out forever .
Ro , how long have we known each other .	I don't think of us that way - ever .
either do I. I love you , Ro . you know that . you're a total mystery to me - but I love YOU .	than letts get rnarried , Michael . I could put a spell on you - and make you say yes .
you're a ve-ry bad witch , you know that ... ?	no , I'm ve-ry good --- and you aught to know .
smoking is bad for your heart , Michael .	hey - I'm getting married in the morning - I already gave up drinking. one Crutch at a time , Doctor .
you're just afraid I'll drop dead before I finish the damn house .	and I thought I was the mindreader .
I took off my gloves today - with Aaron - - and it was okay .	that's GREAT !
aren't we supposed to love somebody for their moral rectitude or their courage or their beneficence -	their what ... ?
so how come I love you most when you stick your finger in your chin ... ?	wanna snack ... ?
a little wine ... ?	hey - you're bleeding .

fall in New Orleans ... This whole town is waterlogged ! the matches , the wood , my clothes , my skin .	that's cause we're below sea level .
Rowan we're below sea level . I've spent time there myself .	that's not funny .
you did that , didn't you ... ?	talking to me dear ... ?
remember the first time we made love - and then ---	- we made a fire .
your beneficence .	I'm serious . whatever it was - it's still there inside me , isn't it - change and all ... ?

I can't leave now . don't ask me to explain ! I just can't !	I've never asked you to explain yourself - because you used to let me inside ! but I'm on the outside now ... you put me there !
Michael - please - just. a little longer . don't leave .	why bother to ask , Ro ... ? why don't you just make me stay , .. ?
stop it !	how' bout a backward hex with a three-quarter twist ... ?
you could kill me - right now , couldn't you ... ? couldn't you ... ? ! tell me the truth --- is it Lasher ... ? answer me ! !	Michael - I'm sorry ... Just give me -
Lasher ... Where --- where is ---	it's alright ... it's airight . he's gone , Michael ... Gone .

the wasps were meant for Michael - but there's only so much you can control , isn't there ? the great and powerful lasher - undone by a faulty ladder- .. Why would you hurt him ... ? ! answer me .	I 1ove you , Rowan . I've always loved you . I only wanted to be in your thoughts . to bring myself into your thoughts - so I could be as we are now .
you violated ME ! ! ! on MY wedding NIGHT !	explain this to me --- violated ... ?
made it ... ?	it is from love .
to love , you must be able to feel .	if you knew how I yearn for that ...
if I could feel like you feel ... but I have only others' feelings - . . like breeres that blow through me . things to be felt , yes --- but not nine to feel ...	it you harm Michael , I will let my anger loose . and you will feel that . do you understand ... ?
	you're very clever , aren't you ... ?
I'm going to have a baby . Michael wants to name it after you - if it's a girl . Diedre Mayfair Curry . pretty , huh ... ? funny --- I never really thought I'd ever ---	I bring her flowers too .
there is no one here but the dead .	go away ! I don't want you here .
if that were true , I would not be here .	it's very dangerous to assume you know what a woman wants .
you crave what I might show you . what you can learn . what I can give you . so much more than Michael can .	what Michael gives me is stronger than anything you could ever inderstand .
but I could understand . I want to understand !	I LOVE him !
do not tell me that !	I LOVE Michael . Michael ! !
I know that you're evil .	I only wanted to see as others do ... feel as others do ... ... but Marguerite could not help me . nor Julien ...
and now you expect me to stockpile corpses for you ... ? !	no , my love . I want nothing more of the dead . I want you to --- Chang me .
--- and I have heard you from the beginning ... from it's very first beat .	I love Michael ...

you went into the cells --- and you changed them . how ... ? !	there was no thought . there was no act . that is not what I am .
I don't know what you are ! ! !	that is what you must discover. see what I am , my love . with all your power - see me , and know what I am .
no !	tell me what I am , Rowan .
Aaron was in the dream . a dream tilled with spirits. you killed him , didn't you ... ?	it was an accident . Gifford , too .
the portraits , Lasher . why are the witches always before a door ... ? tell me , Lasher . now !	they want to come back . we have a pact - of mutual desire and consent . the Mayfairs ar. a beautiful tapestry . I have weaved you all together - from the start . I brought Petyr Van Abel to Suzanne . he had genius in him . scientific , precise . it was a perfect start . and on it has gone - father to mother ... sister to brother ... father to daughter ...
oh god ...	Ju1ien was your father Your great-grandfather - your grandfather - and your father . all one in the same ... That is why he fought carlotta for your life .
Rowan and I will be together now . my time has come . your time is gone .	no ! don't ! Lasher ! ! !

hello ... ? who is this ... ?	who is this ... ?
Rowan Mayfair . who's calling ... ?	I wish to speak to Ellie Mayfair .
I beg your par---	when did she die ... ?
who is this ... ?	this is your aunt . Carlotta Mayfair . in New Orleans .
I don't have any aunts - and I've never heard of a' Carlotta' - or , for that matter - a' Diedre' ! just who -	Diedre Mayfair was your mother .
my ... mother ... ?	yes . listen carefully , Rowan . have your attorney contact me at once . there are matters of immediate -
but my mother ... Ellie said she died -	I under5tand . all the same
-Ellie said she died when I was BORN ! she's been alive ... ? all THIS TIME ... ? why have I been lied to when -	I had you sent away .
who the hel1 -	it was quite warranted by the - situation . I realize this is a shock , but really , Rowan - you never even knew her . it's not as if you've suffered some great -
what's the matter with you ... ? ! what kind of person are you ... ? !	a very tired one . I've been up all night - and I would .like to rest before the funeral . have your lawyer -
when is the funeral ... ? I am coming to my mother's funeral ! !	out of the question Rowan , coming here will not change the -
I'm coming down there ! ! and it you put my mother in the ground betore I arrive , you'll wish you'd never seen my face ! is THAT understood ... ? !	you came . I'm your Aunt Carlotta , my dear .
I want to see my mother . where is she ... ?	in the coffin , my dear. where else ... ?
she was alive all these years ... You NEVER let me know her . who gave you that right ... ? !	a Mayfair it ever I saw one .
I might as well be Rowan Smith - or Jones ! you cut me off from every -	I'm tired . I need to rest .
I don't want the -	other properties as well - here and in Europe . and vest holdings - in sugar , oil , gold , electronics . liquid funds over eighty million. tmpcssible to put a figure on it all . all yours now .
eighty million doll --- ?	and this - if you decide to take the rest .
the lamplight . that's all .	you can see well in the dark , Rowan .
better than most , I suppose .	put your hatred for me aside , so you can clearly see what is ahead-
you kept her in this filth in restraints ... ? .	she didn't feel them
you're a monster .	Antha ... your grandmother ... her life ended there , on the stones . head split open like a melon .
why are you doing this ... ? handing out these horrors ! why ... ? ! !	you have the Mayfair eyes . tell me , Rowan --- what have those eyes seen that the mind can't fathom ... ?
he's shown himself to you ... on the deck . in the storm .	&apos; he' ... ?
Lasher touched you and you loved it .	it Wes a dream ... !
just like your mother - and all the others that felt him - and used his power - and went to hell with a smile !	stop it !
witches . Rowan. that is what we are .	enough ! ! !
and that is why I pushed your grandmother onto the stones - even as she had him inside her ...	you're mad ! your mind is sick !
... and why I put thirty years between you and the beautiful monster . to kill the legacy ! you are the sum of his desires -	you - are - a - murderer .
did you like it ... ? looking down at Graham and knowing what you could do ... ?	I'm NOT like you ! I'm NOT ! you're cruel -
down here. darling , we figure : if you're taking a trip to God knows where - might as well have one hell of a going-away party .	in certain cases , hell is the operative word .
"I'm not saying I believe it ... but I heard it' nough times to know somebody did . they made a deal with the devil . y'know - "" make us rich "" - worship the number thirteen - the whole bit . and some stuff about' bringing them all back through a door ...'"	Gifford Mayfair - I'll cook your tongue on a spit ! witches !
I want to see my mother .	I hope Ryan explained that if you stay in this town , you're shackled with pushy relations for the rest of your life .
he made that quite clear , yes .	Gifford - that box glued to your hands ... ?
aren't they gauche ... ? those steel things are so - common .	nothing worse than a common tool .
you two sees like a perfect fit . only two mounths ... ?	Mm-hmm . seems &amp; lot longer .
always give the crovd a taste , darling . now - Ryan said I'm supposed to make sure -	I don't want it .
&apos; the heir to the fortune must wear the Mayfair pendant an her wedding day .' we should all have to suffer such burdens .	then you wear it .
I'm sure he's alright , Bea . they'll find him somewhere .	it's over a month . the police say it happens all the time .
Jesus I've got - to get to the ho--	Rowan's already called the hotel , Michael . at the cemetery by now , I would guess .
with her family . Rowan's mother died yesterday .	Rowan's mother died at childbirth . and she doesn't have. any family .
I ask only that you stay here , long enough to be - educated . a few hours .	you sound certifiable . yon know that .
a what ... ?	a spirit . perhaps evil ... ... and he has come to you- with Diedre gone - you've ... inherited him .
there is a difference between sensing danger - and being afraid. what defines you in the landscape , Michael ... ? what anchors your life ... ? your work ... ? your creativity ... ?	Rowan .
then focus on how you feel about her . because your feelings define you . take off your gloves , Michael .	don't tell Rowan about this .
Michael , Rowan should -	no ! she's pregnant , Aaron. she's got that to deal with - and the clinic .. she is not to hear about this. don't you think I know she spends half her Lite worrying about me ... listening to my heart , aren't you ... ? the Timex still ticking ... ?
what have the witches always asked of you ... ?	""" go back , Michael . do what you can ... """
on't know what else to do . maybe I just don't belong in her life. well - I'm already out of her life .	nothing was ever more false .
I'll probably be back in a week ... but I can't spend Christmas in that house. you'll check on her - every day ... ?	every day twice .
Aaron - lieten to me ... It's been Lasher - from the start !	what are you talk---
Rowan ...	you have to warn her - this second ! I'm catching the next flight back !
then what is he ... ?	a spacial entity . an organized energy. something that precedes our definition of existence .
going away doesn't mean you leave Lasher behind . he was on Rowan's deck - and the plane ... geography seems irrelevant now .	Michael - you loved that house as a child . you could work again ! you could make it ours . we'll sweep out the horror . and Lasher with it !
thank you for this honor , my dear .	you've been shadowing the family for thirty years . it's only fitting you give one af us away .
I've grown very fond of you you and Michael both .	I have seen him again . last night .
Lasher will act , Rowan . whatever it is he wants - he's waited three hundred years to have it. facing him alone ... I don't like -	Lasher is my legacy - not Michael's . Aaron , I've seen the pain in Michael . I can't bear to see anymore . he's not to know . swear to me .
are you alright ... ? you look pale .	I wish everyone would stop commenting on my health . I'm the doctor .
there are two .	two what ... ?
with his hands !	but why would they do that ... ?
you've always said you felt goodness in them - that the witches brought you and Rowan together . isn't that right ... ? they're reaching out to you , Rowan !	but it doesn't make sense . they - they used Lasher ... they conspired with him .
: what , you're doing Darcy ? since when ?	: no , I said , I hate what I'm doing to Darcy . oh , boy , men are stupider , it's true .
: would you stop it !	: well , they are .
": what do you mean "" They "" are ? are you officially a woman now ?"	: oh , I wish . a woman wouldn't have screwed over the woman she loved . no , they don't think that way .
Christ , that's twice in ... When did they move in ?	I think three ...

whatcha reading ?	genetic repair mechanisms in eukaryotic organisms .
how is it ?	excellent . couple of Swedish sailor cells just gang divided a virginal cheerleader cell .
nice . almost done .	if you have to work ...
fine .	it's okay if you're not .
I am , really .	it's just she's been the focus for a while .
not the focus .	you know what I mean .
to tell you the truth ... I'm excited .	you are ...
to get my life back . to have some time for myself . some time for us .	you did a great job . she's a good kid .
we did .	it's just us now .
I know .	tired ?
Nope .	wanna fool around ?
Yup .	did you ...
and we moved out here for the quiet .	mmm .
maybe we should just ...	tomorrow .
I'm finished at three . no . squash with Stan .	after that .
of him I think .	did she say that ?
more or less .	honey , they're young . they're probably newlyweds .
I'm telling you . there was something in her voice ...	remember how we were ?
not like this . we were never like this . I want to go over there . after dinner , we can--	why ?
to make sure she's all right .	Claire , honey , we are not going to march next door and accuse our new neighbor of--
that's not what I'm sug--	... when tonight they'll probably be keeping us awake .
but what if something happens ?	Claire ...
I'd never be able to live with mysel--	nothing's going to happen . besides , I have to work tonight . the conference is in less than two weeks . I've got to stay focused on that for just a little longer . this is ...
I know .	it's what I've been working for .
I just wish you could have heard her .	look , I'll call Harvey Tomes in the psych department , see what I can find out .
Mmnph .	hurry ...
nothing . there was ... I thought I saw something .	is it gone ?
hi .	I'm stuck here for another couple of hours .
oh .	unless you need me to come home ...
Claire ?	huh ? absolutely . take your time .
what are you doing here ?	there were some noises . I didn't want to disturb you .
what do you mean ? some noises where ?	in the house . I was scared .
did you call the police ?	no . can you drive me home ? I'll bring you back in the morning .
of course .	it was there . this angry music all by itself . and I heard whispering .
what kind of whispering ?	I don't know . just ... whispering .
I've got the conference next week . I want you to feel safe .	I do , I do . I'm sure I'm just ... how was your day ?
think I may have cracked it .	really ?
I think so . maybe .	you are so brilliant .
yep .	Madame Curie , Jonas Salk , Norman Spencer ...
you're kidding .	he's here giving some arcane spiel for the physics department , so Bob shine introduces us ...
wow .	"and he says ... you'll fucking love this , he says , "" Doctor Spencer , I am a great admirer of your work ... """
well , that's nice .	""" ... especially Spencer's theorem ... """
oh , no ...	""" ... of Perpetual distances . "" everybody's checking their shoelaces . pins drop . "" I'm afraid you've mistaken me , "" I say ..."
that's ...	""" ... for my father . """
I'm so sorry .	didn't know he was dead , every stinking paper on the globe .
that's just mean . oh . Jody wanted to know if I could get her some .	did you tell her ?
what ? no . no .	you didn't ?
sorry . you understand .	did you call about the Feurs ?
oh , right . yes . Harvey says the guy's a sweetheart . wouldn't hurt a fly .	huh .
get down ! he'll see .	what's going on , Claire ?
he killed her .	what ?
he did . she's in the picture . I went over to look and she's gone . the table was set for one .	and that means he murdered his wife ? this is getting ridic--
our house .	no . look ! in the window .
it's a flare .	a flare ?
from the sun . it's a reflection on the glass .	it's her ! I'm telling you . she whispered and turned on the music . she's trying to contact me !
where is she then ?	she could be out . she could be sick in bed for all we know .
what am I looking at ?	I didn't do that .
who did ? Mrs. Feur ?	maybe . point is ... not me .
she was lonely , I talked to her . Norman , I know how it looks , but--	Claire , listen to me . I know you're under some strain . but there's no such thing as ghosts . they don't exist . our neighbor did not kill his wife , and I ... wait , why aren't you dressed ?
dressed ?	dinner . with Stan and his new girl .
when ?	what do you mean ? Claire , we talked about it . you didn't want Japanese , I said , Our first date since ...
oh .	... since Caitlin . you don't remember this ?
tonight ?	yes , tonight . we're going to be--
when you do this , I swear ...	... Don't get all ...
... like it never even happened ...	okay , okay , I'm sure that I just ...
what are you doing ?	restaurant . let them know we're running late .
we're going to be fine .	there we go .
Harvey says he's amazing .	Norman ...
Claire , she's been a huge part of your life for seventeen years . if you weren't thrown off balance by this , then something would be wrong .	"I never said I wasn't upset . of course I'm upset . I miss her terribly . but I know what I saw and what I heard ... and it wasn't some "" symptom "" of something ..."
I never said ...	... and I don't think I'm some lonely , middle-aged woman cracking up .
are you lonely ?	no ! and I don't need a psychiatrist !
what are you doing out here ?	he killed her . I'm not crazy . he killed her and--
this is the Feur thing ?	yes . and he's going to get away with it .
how do you know this ?	we had a seance .
Jody and I. And she was there , Norman , she was . it scared Jody so bad she had to leave .	how did you--
what ?	maybe you resent how busy I've been .
what are you ... ? no .	you know what I've got at stake with this paper . you know that . I can't help but think that you're doing this now to hurt me , or to sabotage me somehow .
sabotage ?	ever since the accident I've been worried that you'd been unhappy , or ...
the accident ... ?	but then you've been so much better ...
Norman , this isn't about you . this is something that's happening to me . it's not to get even ... and it's not some warped bid for attention . some strange things are happening in our house , whether you believe in them or not ...	Sweetheart--
keep your voice down .	I will NOT .
... I'm pulling up , Yuri . I'll see you for dinner . sure you won't stay ?	no , it's fine . I'm fine .
yep .	call ya later .
what ?	are you glad ? I'm glad .
you know I am .	good . you sat in front ... I saw you there ...
you were lost in the music ... eyes closed ... your chest heaving ...	I felt you ... looking through me ...
you don't remember ?	when she said it , there was something familiar ... but no .
you dropped a glass .	I ...
in the living room ...	you shoved me away and ran out to the patio . I took you home .
but why ? I can't understand how I could just completely--	it was maybe a week after the accident . we were moving . it was a hard time .
but I don't remember .	sweetheart , it was over a year ago .
I may have seen her on campus .	not personally .
no . I'm afraid to ask what this is about .	it's her . this is the woman who I've seen .
the ...	yes . the ghost .
I thought it was Mrs. Feur , but it's not ...	stop ...
... I'm positive this time ...	... Please stop ...
it's Madison Fra--	stop IT !
I take it your not mad at me .	wouldn't go that far .
OW !	what's the matter ?
it's too rough .	since when ?
I don't like this , this ...	why don't you shut up and fuck me , Professor .
I think she's starting to suspect something .	who ?
your wife ...	stop IT !
""" you know ... """	what ?
I was there .	Claire--
I came to work in the garden and I saw you with her ... in my house .	oh God ...
it was last year . we were having troubles .	so you fucked a student ? !
that's not what I'm sayi--	don'T touch me . just get away from me . go !
Claire , please don't ...	what did you think I would do ? Jesus Christ ! I gave up my life and my music ...
I never asked you to quit !	... Oh BULLSHIT . you had to topple perfect Daddy and that meant perfect wife , perfect family ...
that'S NOT true ! you wanted to quit ! and then when you did , you hated me for it ... so you gave it all to her .	who ?
to Caitlin ! !	leave her out of this !
and then out of nowhere , some bright young woman found me attractive ...	stop ...
... would do anything just to be around me . and I slipped . God help me , I slipped .	I'm not going to listen to this .
I tried to break it off !	you should have tried harder .
Claire ...	get out of my way .
she was damaged and unstable . the more I tried to distance myself , the more desperate she became . finally , she showed up at the new house ...	how did she know where it was ?
she did it .	we don't know that for sure .
of course she did , Norman . what else could it be ?	we have to get out of here .
it's alright .	can't you see , she's trying to kill us .
she's gone .	what ?
she can't be here without me .	how can you be sure ?
I don't know , but I am . she was there and then she was gone . I felt it .	Claire ...
the leaves ...	incredible . we should take a drive before they're gone . spend the night at some cozy little bed and breakfast .
look for antiques ...	yep . there's some great places nearby .
what ?	little village down seven . supposed to be charming .
huh .	do you know it ?
don't think so .	maybe we can stop there for lunch .
what's that for ?	nothing .
I'm cooking you dinner .	you don't have to do that .
I know .	fine . I'll do the shopping .
she's out there isn't she ? she's in the lake .	okay . don't ... you don't understand what this is .
don't I , Norman ? you kept THE FUCKING necklace . of a woman you killed !	I did NOT ! I did not kill anyone . Jesus . Claire , listen to me . I walked in and she was lying there dead . I swear to you . on my life ! she took pills and she killed herself in our house to destroy me ! to destroy us ! if I hadn't stopped by here before school , the painters would have--
I don't believe you .	it'S true . that's ... you have to believe me ! oh God , I'm telling you the truth ! I did what I had to , Claire . she was gone . there was nothing I could do for her . I did ... I put her in the lake . I rolled the car in ... and I watched it sink . and I've lived with that image ever since . I couldn't just stand there while everything-- my career , us , everything , just washed away . don't you see , Claire ? she's doing this ! this is exactly what she wants you to think !
Mmmuh ...	shhhh .
Mauduh ...	what ?
how you holding up ?	good . I'm good .
you are ?	why does everyone find that so surprising ?
cause ... your ... only daughter just went away to school ... who you were incredibly close with aaand I'd be tripping ...	okay , I'm a little tender .
well good . so you're human .	and so far my day has consisted of taking pictures of my roses for the garden club .
wow . got here just in time . I brought you this .	what is it ?
Kambucha mushroom tea ...	Jody--
it soothes heart-ache and promotes psychic wellness . Sela suggested I bring--	you're discussing me with your psychic ?
she's not a psychic . just a very enlightened spirit .	thanks , but I'm fine .
so you'll have some later . notice anything ... different ?	oh my god . you bought it .
yep .	it's niiice .
beautiful thing , alimony . lose a husband , get a car . think it'll help me pick up dudes ?	absolutely .
listen , I've gotta run . I just thought I'd stop by and see if you want to take the boat out , say Thursday morning ?	you got it .
you think he killed her ?	I don't know . when you say it , it sounds crazy . but what else could it all be ?
know what I think ?	what ?
Seance .	Jody , no ...
telling you ...	... no ... no ... no ...
just bought this beautiful antique ouija .	please . that's all I need .
someone's there .	what ?
in the window . Norman's at work .	I don't ...
wow . I'm losing it .	no , you're not . but a presence in your house is not something to be taken lightly .
sit down here .	are we hoping the ghost is going to have to pee ?
place your fingers on the planchette .	the planchette ?
we wish to commune with the spirit of Mrs. Feur . what's her first name ?	I don't know .
nothing's happening .	shhh .
oh ...	M-E ...
Mef ? what's Mef ?	it's initials . F is Feur . it's her .
I have to go .	Jody , wait .
are you okay ?	I think so
I'm sorry for leaving , but I mean , Jesus , Claire ...	it's alright .
Jody , she's alive .	what ?
Mrs. Feur . she's alive . I met her . she's really sweet .	then what was it ?
nothing . it wasn't anything . I've been on edge lately . maybe since the accident . and I'd prefer , I really would , to just--	something was there . you saw it .
did I ?	yes . now I talked to Sela and there's a guy , this Pakistani guy down in Hartford ...
Hartford ?	and he's the real thing . Specializes in cases like this , like yours .
no . Jody , listen to me . you have to listen to me . this is not something that I can do right now . whatever it was , it's gone . I need it to be gone now .	but Claire--
please .	okay . okay .
oh God ... you knew .	I was down in adamant ...
adamant ?	Artsy little village down seven . there's a guy there who sells my work . I had just dropped off some paintings and as I got in my car ... I saw Norman sitting at this little cafe .
I started to walk over ... but he wasn't alone . a blond . I only caught a glimpse . she was young . I should have said something right away . but I didn't .	why ?
partly because I didn't want to hurt you ... but partly ... partly because I was relieved .	relieved ?
too late ? Jody , it was an accident .	alone ? on a two lane road ? with a ton of Valium in your system ?
I got there first . Stan covered up the pills and I had it out with Norman . he seemed desperate not to lose you . he promised to handle it . and we all let it drop away .	all of us .
I'm a terrible friend .	no .
how could I expect you to tell me something that I wouldn't even tell myself ?	what are you going to do ?
I don't know .	if she was dangerous before--
she could have hurt me if she wanted to .	you don't know that . if it's your belief that gives her form , then you've got to shut her out . somehow you have to break the connection .
Jody , she tried to kill him .	I know .
I can't believe this is happening .	we need help . please let me call the medium .
that could take days . I need to do something now . don't you see ? she wants us dead .	Alight , alright . stay calm . you opened this door . there's got to be a way that you can close it .
like what ?	I have an idea . but , I mean , I'm just making this up ...
but he acted like he'd never heard of it .	did he say that ?
what if he was ? do you think he wanted to bring that up again just when you're trying to make a new start ?	I guess not .
I don't know ...	trust me , Claire . you hear something ... change the subject . you find something ... get rid of it , throw it in the lake . you know what happened . the rest is only details . and no one's ever glad they got a hold of those . if you want to put this back together ... just let it go .
wow .	this is ...
he looked like one of the Monkees .	anyway , Claire slept with him ...
I didn't sleep with him .	... just so she could cut them off .
I came in from my room ...	we were suite mates .
and there's this brilliant conductor in purple briefs with no bangs cursing his ass off in Finnish .	oh God ...
you should have heard her play .	stop .
we both auditioned for the Philharmonic . one cello position open .	do we have to ?
and I kicked ass . my best stuff . then I stood in the hallway and listened to her audition ... and I cried .	she's making this up .
she got it . turned it down .	I met a dashing young grad student after a recital one night ...
Mrs. Frank ?	yeah .
I'd like to talk to you about Madison .	you know where she is ?
what's your name ?	Claire .
just plain old coffee . none of that mocha nonsense .	it's fine .
you look a little old for a student .	I'm not . we ... we met at a party .
sounds about right . never understood how a girl that wild got all A's . sure didn't get it from me . they wanted to put her in a special school for the gifted when she was young . Maddie wouldn't hear about it .	she never mentioned her father .
why are you here ?	I don't know .
full scholarships . Princeton too . she wanted to stay close .	you must have been very proud .
they're calling me in to work .	I should be going anyway .
y'hear anything you'll let me know ?	of course .
what was her major ?	biology . she wanted to be a doctor .
who are you ?	it's Mrs ... It's Claire ... Spencer . from next door . is everything--
you're the flower lady .	um ... yes .
I've seen you . from the window .	is everything alright ?
hello ?	I'm not ...
he's so ... it's too much ... and I can't ... I can't breath ...	who ? your husband ?
and I'm afraid . oh god , I'm so afraid of ...	what ? what are you afraid of ?
I can't , no , no , I can't ...	tell me . please .
that I'll just ... that one day I'll just ... disappear .	tell me . I can help you .
how ? how can you help me ? with your flowers and your perfect life ...	that's not ... It's not like that .
I've never even met you .	I know . and I'm sorry . I've been consumed with ... my daughter left ... for school .
this fence ... it's so ...	I'm sorry . it's for the flowers . why don't you ...
oh God . he's back . I'm sorry . please forget that I ... I don't know what I'm saying . please ...	wait ! don't go ...
I wanted to apologize .	you do ?
for scaring you like I did . when I thought about what that must have seemed like that day ...	and then you weren't there .
right . I'm sorry .	would you like some iced tea ?
no .	of what ? what were you so afraid of ?
love .	what ?
um ... sure .	I couldn't catch my breath . that's not a metaphor , that's ... And I panicked . I never dreamed anyone would hear me back there ... I tried to leave him . went to my mother's in Boston . he brought my things up and pleaded with me to come home .
you must think I'm pathetic .	no . no , I don't .
I'm sorry that I frightened you like that . but I was so touched by your concern . I've been lonely here . perhaps we could be friends .	yes ?
um ...	I'm running late here . I just came back for my briefcase .
right . well , I wanted to stop by to welcome you to the uh , to the neighborhood . I'm Claire Spencer . from next door .	this really isn't a good time .
she isn't here .	when ... when will she be back ?
I don't know .	Oh-kay ...
who ?	give me that shit . your wife .
of course . you must be so proud .	I am .
how're you holding up ?	just fine . it's a lovely party .
Norman was telling me the dream house is finally finished .	almost .
I'm sorry ?	I know how hard it can be sometimes .
Uh-huh . what can be ?	well , I don't think I've seen you since the reception at Dean Ackerman's last year .
for the Dupont Chair . I swear . I'm becoming the nosy old lady I used to run from at Amherst .	no . I'm just not sure what you mean .
there was just ... some tension . you were upset . I remember being concerned .	at the party .
toward the end . you remember ?	Ohhh yes . no , no . just a little , you know ... We're fine .
well , I'm glad . pardon my intrusiveness , but we do have to stick together you know .	who's that ?
who's idea was it ?	mine . his . we both ... thought ...
I didn't want to come .	then why did you ?
because he was worried about me .	your husband ?
yes . I'm sure he's hoping you'll pack me full of prozac so he can live out his life in peace .	do you really think so ?
no .	why is he worried ?
because , I don't know , because sometimes ... sometimes I forget things ... and ever since Caitlin left , ever since my daughter left for school , there've been ... I fainted and ... Why is this so hard ?	fireball ?
these are good .	Mm-hmm .
she finished my solitaire game and turned on the radio ... she likes rock and roll . angry rock and roll .	how do you know it's a she ?
I saw her in the water . beside me . she was filling the bathtub .	what does she look like ?
pretty . she's a blond .	do you have any idea who she is ?
um ... I'd rather not say ... just yet .	fine .
what ?	try to communicate with her somehow .
you think that'll help ?	can't hurt . and I think it's important you find out what she wants .
are you humoring me ?	Nope .
how ?	I don't know . my aunt used to use my uncle's old pajamas and a candle .
what's happening to me ?	well , that's what we're here for .
whether you imagined it or not , you actually saw and heard things that frightened you ... that gave you reason for concern .	yes , but ...
your friend saw them .	isn't there something called group hysteria ?
maybe . I don't know . I just know that when all this was happening , I felt , some part of me felt ... alive . like somebody needed me . and the more I reached out to , it , the Fuller it became .	you're saying you willed these events to happen ?
"she said , "" You know . "" that I know ."	do you ?
no .	what do you think ? guess .
I felt ... pain . that she'd been hurt by someone . this is great . I'm trying to intuit the emotions of a figment of my--	have you been hurt ?
me ? no . well , in the accident I was injured , but ...	you were in an accident ?
what ?	that he doesn't ... see me , or , you know , that I'm ... that's something's wrong ... with me .
that can't feel good .	"no , it doesn't ... Okay , look , I see what you're doing here , and that's , I'm sorry , but that's not it . my marriage is fine . I've had some kind of "" empty-nest "" episode where I saw some things that weren't there . let's deal with that . I'm willing to deal with that . I just don't want to go conjuring problems where none exist ."
hey .	yes ?
it's only two hours away .	I know that .
I'll come back all the time .	of course you will .
that was very good .	Mom , I'm sorry . I wanted to tell you . but it never felt right .
besides , Dad would have freaked .	no , he wouldn't .
"I think playing in a band called "" Bitch "" might put a dent in the whole "" perfect family "" thing ."	that's not true .
yes it is . can we please not do that ? please ? cause it is .	he loves you very much . he just--
so much .	it got so bad your father almost had to put me away .
what do you mean ?	I started seeing things .
a ghost ?	did you ?
no . but once I heard ...	what ?
someone crying . a girl . I thought I was crazy .	then we both are .
stop saying things so loud !	oh ! the virgin has spoken ! Sarah Stop it !
save it for the powder room babe , this man is in pain	you guys are being real assholes
you bet . we all can't be such modern people	come on Mark mark Ah hell , why not . I'll get the maid to write the essays

guys , if I'm going to play the hero at least give me a little room .	safety in numbers man .
this time I really don't see anyone man .	must be what we came for . the four stand slowly and enter through the doors , which close behind them . they begin walking around the WAXWORKS , which appear gruesome . the first they spy is of a high school student with a letter jacket on the verge of being hacked with an axe by and angry woodsman . they give each other looks of disgust and continue on . the next is of a Frankenstein-esque creature carrying a woman in its arms . the four are now roaming around the WAXWORKS individually , with TONY encountering what appears to be a tribal INDIAN pointing a knife towards a victim . mark walks past a circus cart with some sort of werebeast inside , and then continues on to a staircase exhibit with a dead woman at the base of it . on the staircase is a zombie-fied creature . we see China walking on the other side of a bandage wrapped man pumping gasoline into a woman's mouth . finally , we see TONY walking up to a cottage room display .
haven't we been doing our homework .	I've always wondered why someone would believe in something like that .
getting scared ? don't worry , they've probably just gone home .	what ? Tony and China , together ?
Wooo . jealously rearing its ugly head .	I'm not kidding . I want to get out of here - now , ok .
then why do you still like her ?	like her ? I don't know if I ever liked her . it's just you want what you can't get .
I don't know . I really like you and I think you're very attractive .	come on .
no I'm serious . it's. it's just I don't know I. I'm looking for something else .	no , no James , it's not like that . Tony and China , they're just friends .
that's not what you said last night .	OK , so maybe I was a little over emotional .

OK toots , I will .	oh Mark . it's ok . it's ok .

oh I don't give a shit the guy's a slob . he doesn't even know how to spell' lady' let alone treat me like one . you know the last time we went out he actually made me pay for a drink ?	he did ?
yes , I'm sure . what I need is an older man , something with class , a little style . someone who knows how to treat a lady .	businessman ?
businessman !	doctor ? lawyer ? China lawyer , Doctor , I don't care .
yeah	so why are you dating Jonathan ?
but ?	but he still has something Mark hasn't .
what's that ?	a body . I mean we're talking major body
with all due respect , Mr. Gekko , what's to prevent you from doing the same thing ?	cause I have a way around all this , a way we can all make money and make this airline profitable again . what do you say we cut to the chase . I'm asking for a modest twenty percent across-the-board wage cut .
are you prepared to put that in writing ?	I'll have a letter of agreement drawn up within two days .
cards are on the table . what do you think ?	if you mean what you say , I think we're in the ball park . I'll take it to my people .
we know what you're up to , Gekko , and let me tell you this from here , you suck eggs , mister , over my dead body you ain't gonna break up Bluestar .	you guys must know something nobody else knows . if those are my plans , it's the first I've heard of it .
listen , you clowns , there's somebody else out there trying to buy your airline , if you want to be Pac-manned and gobbled by Atilla the Hun be my guest !	we'll take our chances . nice to see you again , Mr. Gekko .
rarest pistol in the world , Larry , a .45 Luger . only six were ever manufactured .	congratulations but rarer still is your interest in Anacott Steel .
the same interest as yours Larry . money . I thought it'd be a good investment for my kid ...	no . this time I'm in for the long term . this is not a liquidation , Gordon . I'm going to turn it around . you're getting a free ride on my tail , mate , and with the dollars you're costing me to buy back the stock , I could modernize the plant . I'm not the only one who pays here Gordon . we're talking about lives and jobs ; three and four generations of steel workers ...
considering you brought my mother into it , $ 71.50 .	done . you'll hear from my lawyers . 8 a.m. Good night .
yeah , Billy , who's your buyer ? ... No , not interested . Ollie , start calling a the institutions , start with Marx at Janson Mutual , then Reardon . get me that California retirement money , baby ! and we're on our way !	you got it , G.G.
he respond to the offer ? what ? what the hell's Cromwell doing giving lecture tours when his company's losing 60 million a quarter ? I guess he's giving lectures on how to lose money ... if this guy opened a funeral parlor , no one would die , this turkey's totally brain dead ... Well Christmas is over and business is business . keep buying . dilute the sonofabitch . Ollie I want every orifice in his body flowing red .	he's flowing , Gordo . piece of cake .
hey , the Terminator ! blow' em away Ollie .	and , I'm pretty sure we got the Beezer Brothers out of Tulsa coming in with us and I'm working on the Silverberg boys in Canada .
what do you say we go get a suite at the Carlyle ? caviar ? champagne ? celebrate , just like the old times Sunshine .	those days are over , Gordon . they were over a long time ago .
it's not puppy love , Gordon . anyway , Buddy and I are splitting up .	sorry to hear that . I thought the kid had staying power .
it's over you , Gordon .	you told him about us ?
now tell me , why would I want to do that ?	because I don't want to see him hurt .
don't worry Sunshine . Bud and I had a little talk . we came to an understanding . I want you to go back to him . soothe him . help keep his head straight . okay ?	I can't ... and I won't .
come on , we both like Buddy . but this bleeding heart puppy love act is over the top ... It doesn't fit .	maybe it does . don't patronize me Gordon .
you and I are the same , Darien . we're smart enough not to buy into the oldest myth running : love ... A fiction created by people who got nothing to keep them from jumping out of windows .	you're really twisted , Gordon . you're incapable of giving to anybody because deep down inside you there's a poverty that every last dollar in the world won't fill .
I thought this was an informal meeting . what's he doing here ?	Harold , you don't mind strolling around the block a couple hundred times , do you ?
frankly , Carl , I can't see giving much more . if you have any suggestions I'll be glad to listen .	there came into Egypt a Pharoah who did not know .
I beg your pardon . is that a proverb ?	no , it's a prophecy . the rich have been doing it to the poor since the beginning of time . the only difference between the Pyramids and the Empire State Building is that the Egyptians didn't have unions . I know what this guy is about-- greed--he's in and out for the buck and he don't take prisoners . he don't give a damn about Northstar or us ...
fine , if you don't want us , stay with the scum in present management--dedicated to running you and Bluestar into the ground .	"... that "" scum "" built this company up from one plane in thirty years , they made something out of nothing , and if that's a scum I'll take one over a rat any day ..."
you got a look in your eye , Mr. Mannheim ... You got something for the small fry ...	Jesus , can't make a buck in this market , country's going to hell faster than when that sonofabitch Roosevelt was around ... too much cheap money sloshing around the world . the biggest mistake we ever made was letting Nixon get off the gold standard . Putney Drug--you boys might want to have a look at it .
sleep with me and the secrets of the West are yours .	now that's a crap company , sure you'll make money on the takeover rumor , but what's being created . nothing . no substance behind it .
no such thing Bud -' cept death and taxes . not a good company anymore , no fundamentals . what's going on Bud ? do you know something ? remember there're no short cuts son , quick buck artists come and go with every bull market but the steady players make it through the bear markets . you're part of something here , Bud . the money you make for people creates science and research jobs . don't sell that out .	you're right , Mr. Mannheim , but you gotta get to the big time first , then you can be a pillar and do good things .
can't get a little bit pregnant , Bud .	it's a winner Mr. Mannheim , trust me -- buy .
you're on a roll kiddo . enjoy it while it lasts --' cause it never does .	... just kickin' ass and taking names , Mr. Mannheim .
how you doing Buddy ?	great Carolyn , doing any better would be a sin ...
morning Buddy , you look happy .	any better and I'd be guilty .
you were never that innocent sugarpie .	... how do you know ? you wish ...
Bud ! where you been the last two days ?	... Janet get my father on the phone and the two other union reps , urgent ...
he had a heart attack , hon , but he's okay , he's at the hospital ...	oh Christ !
hello again , I been holding these drinks for us for the last three weeks .	excuse me .
grand Marnier . a romantic and tragic drink .	oh yes , I remember you .
destiny took us apart , but I knew it would bring us back together .	Aha . poet or philosopher ?
stock broker . as in : never have so few done so little for so much . so what do you see in this ?	I'd give anything to have this in my house , even for a week .
... few thousand dollars down the drain if you ask me .	oh really ? well , I guess you can kiss that career as an art appraiser goodbye , because we paid over four hundred thousand for it at the Contemporary picture sale last June .
you could have a great beach house for that .	sure you could , in Wildwood , New Jersey . if you sold this , you could have a pretty nice penthouse on Fifth . but you wouldn't have much left over for decoration .
boy , I thought Gordon was a tough businessman , but somebody's really taking him to the cleaners here .	not really . I'd say that Gordon is one of the most astute collectors around . he has a great eye and he only buys the best . like this rug for instance , a silk Tabriz , the finest of its kind . the day after he bought it in London , a dealer representing the Saudi Royal Family offered him twice what he paid . it absolutely makes the room . see how this little bit of celadon in the border is picked up in the cushions oh the sofa ... although ... I don't know if I would have used that tea dipped linen for the upholstery - too dingy . and it's a sacrilege having that Pre-Columbian pot in the center of the coffee table . some dope might use it as an ashtray .
I gather you're a decorator .	you got it , a great spender of other people's money .
well , if you're that good , you could probably do wonders at my place .	where is it ?
upper West Side .	oh really . home of the exposed brick wall and the houseplant .
oh it's just a rental . I'm moving to the East Side soon . I've got a couple of deals brewing with Gordon. but that's just conversation ... what about real things ? like dinner . the two of us . Friday . cafe . Santo Domingo .	what if I have a previous engagement ?
break it .	I guess this must be destiny alright . my first yuppie apartment and ... my first yuppie .
you really do believe in destiny ?	only if I want something bad enough .
Devon ? he looks like Seattle slew . what about the triple Crown ?	he's not a racehorse , Bud , he's a jumper .
how would I know ? I once bet a horse . he went out at ten to one and came in at quarter to five .	if I could have anything ... this would almost do .
so , how did your conference go with Gordon ?	the conference , oh yeah . fine . we reached an agreement and decided to divide up the world between us .
you have modest wants . I like that in a man .	and what do you want ?
... a Turner , a perfect canary diaiaond ... a Lear jet ... world peace ... the best of everything ...	well , why stop at that ?
I don't .	you're not trouble by any chance . are you ?
... isn't it perfect !	... too perfect ... let's not even eat . let's just watch it and think about it .
you know , the elevator man couldn't believe I paid $ 300,000 to have my walls looking like this , he's got them for free in Brooklyn .	"I'll bet he's got an opinion on the stock market too . this apartment is already ahead of its time . I call it the "" demolished "" look . they've already heard about it at House and Garden and they're coming next week to photograph it before it gets ... lived in . is that alright ? I'd love to have it in my portfolio ."
let's get things straight , Bud . I'm not going to take a cut . I worked hard and you can't decorate a room in New York for less than $ 100,000 . curtains alone ...	I'm kidding , I'm kidding , we're still young , Darien . so what's money anyway when everybody's making it , it's all relative . after all , this is not the house in Connecticut , this is just a crash pad good for a couple of years ... before we slip our two lovely kids , yuppie and Fruppie into the Lycee Francaise .
you got it all charted out don't you , like a stock projection .	that's right -- one with high yield , rich assets and no downside ...
do you think you're ready ?	it's not me I'm worried about ... You know Darien , the only reason we haven't slept together is because we both know we will -- and not knowing when was the only surprise left . you owe me , I want you , what else is there ... but you , me , the world . ... right here ... make love to me ... now ... Stop me if I'm going too far .
Bud , I hate to tell you this but you're a genius ! Darien ... lightning has struck ! the lightbulb has been invented . Edison , Da Vinci , Einstein are watching ...	... are you going to trade all night again ? you got to go to work in a couple of hours .
get in bed . y'ever hear of the sixty hour work week ? you're turning into a yuppie Frankenstein , you love money so much .	sure , why not , money's the sex of the 80's . I never had it like you when I was growing up , baby , it wasn't the upper east side .
you're so naive Bud , you don't even know . your dad took care of you . I might've been rich when I was a kid ... but my father lost all his money ... in the Seventies , in the stock market , at the track . he was a lousy gambler ...	... that changes all my plans , I thought you were loaded ...
fear . the fear of being poor I guess , just like you , Darien ... But that's all gonna change sweetheart . I'm catching the express ... ... and you're going along for the ride .	I'm sorry . I was afraid something like this could happen .
talk about being bent over the sink of life and being dry humped . I handed it to him on a silver platter . I told my father and those people ...	buddy , it's not your fault , and it's not your decision .
I'm not gonna let it happen Darien .	don't cross Gordon . he'll crush you . you've worked hard to get where you are . if Gordon doesn't buy Bluestar someone else will ; and who's to say they won't do the same thing .
at least I wouldn't be pulling the trigger .	are you mad ! why are you doing this ! we're so close , the town is going to be ours . don't throw away your future Bud !
I can stay with the brokerage firm . and you're doing fine . we can survive without Gordon Gekko .	I'm not looking to just survive . I've been doing that all my life .
you really mean that ? what'd he promise you ? to take you public ? I guess without Gordon's money and seal of approval , I'm not such a hot investment anymore . you're just the best money can buy , Darien ...	you're not exactly pure Bud , you went after Gekko with the same vengeance you went after me . look in the mirror before ...
you may not believe this Bud but I really do care for you . I think we could've made a good team ... but that's how it goes ...	get the hell out !
hi .	why ?
how do you do Mr. Gekko . I'm Bud Fox .	so you say . nice to meet you ; hope you're intelligent . like these , how'd you get these ?
so what s on your mind kimosabe ? why am I listening to you ? got to monitor my blood pressure , so whatever you do , don't upset me .	oh no , no ...
within 45 seconds , a microprocessor computes your systolic and diastolic pressure . has an LCD readout , and it's cost effective -- less than one visit to the doctor .	I just want to let you know Mr. Gekko I read all about you at NYU Business , and I think you're an incredible genius and I've always dreamed of only one thing -- to do business with a man like you ...
so what firm you with , pal ?	Jackson , Steinem ...
... Yeah , and we're working on some other interesting stuff .	... A cosmetics company by any chance ? what are you , the 12th man on the deal team ? the last to know ?
can't tell you that , Mr. Gekko .	so whatta you got for me , sport ? why are you here ?
chart break-out on this one here ... uh Whitewood-Young Industries ... low P.E. explosive earnings . 30 % discount from book . great cash flow . coupla 5 % holders . strong management .	it's a dog , what else you got , sport , besides connections at the airport ?
... rings a bell somewhere . so what ?	a comer . 80 medium-body jets . 300 pilots , flies northeast , Canada , some Florida and Caribbean routes ... great slots in major cities ...
... don't like airlines , lousy unions ...	there was a crash last year . they just got a favorable ruling on a lawsuit . even the plaintiffs don't know .
how do you know ?	I know ... the decision'll clear the way for new planes and route contracts . there's only a small float out there , so you should grab it . good for a five point pop .
my home number's on the back ...	Bud Fox , I look at a hundred ideas a day . I choose one .
hi sport .	nice to see you again Mr. Gekko .
see this ? can you believe it ? two inch screen ...	... I can't even see it ...
... for my kid Rudy -- 3 years old , electronics freak , got a liquid crystal display' stead of an electronic beam . we're going into a new age pal . so how's business today .	Bluestar was at 21 and an eighth when I left the office . it might spin up to 25 by the bell ...
Teldar's shooting up . buy any for yourself ? bet you were on the phone two minutes after you got out of my office .	no sir , that would've been illegal ...
Mr. Gekko -- thank you for the chance . you won't regret this , you're with a winner .	... put the rest of it in a money market account for now . I want to see what you know before I invest it ... and save the cheap salesman talk , it's obvious .
excuse me sir .	... come on sport , you gotta try harder , I need some exercise for chrissake ...
Mr. Gekko , I don't think I can ... go on .	... finish out the game , Bud , push yourself ...
nice club , Mr. Gekko ...	yeah ... not bad for a City College boy . bought my way into this club and now every one of these ivy league schmucks is sucking my kneecaps ... I just got on the Board of the Zoological Society , cost me a million ; that's the thing with WASPS -- they like animals but they can't stand people !
uh , Mr. Gekko , we took a little loss today . we got stopped out on Tarafly ... ... about 50 thousand .	I guess your father's not a union representative on that company .
what ? how do you know about my father ?	the most valuable commodity I know of is information . wouldn't you agree on that ?
know the name ?	&apos; course . Larry Wildman . one of the first Raiders .
sir Larry Wildman . like all Brits he thinks he was born with a better pot to piss in ... bribed an old secretary of mine to open bar mouth and stole RDL pharmaceuticals right out from under me . Wildman the white knight .	I remember that deal . you were involved ?
revenge is a dish best served cold ... well , it's payback time , sport . ... see that building ? I bought into it ten years ago . it was my first real estate deal . I sold it a couple of years later and made an $ 800,000 dollar profit . it was better than sex . at that time I thought that was all tne money in the world ... Now , it's a day's pay ... I had a mole in Wildman's employ . gave me half the picture , then he got fired ...	I don't understand .
Wildman's in town . he just became an American citizen . something big's about to go down . I want to know where he goes and who he sees . I want you , sport , to give me the missing half of the picture ...	follow him ? Mr. Gekko I ... It's not what I do . I could lose my license . if the SEC found out , I could go to jail . it's inside information , isn't it ?
inside information . oh you mean like when a father tells his son about a court ruling on an airline ? or someone overhears me saying I'm gonna buy Teldar Paper ? or the chairman of the board of XYZ suddenly knows it's time to blow out XYZ . you mean that ? I'm afraid sport , unless you got a father on the board of directors of another company , you and I are gonna have a hard time doing any business ...	what about hard work ?
I got all I could get which was 750,000 shares plus 5000 March 50 calls . average price of $ 47 a share And $ 4 per contract for the call . I just wish I could've got more .	don't expect to get it all , sport , you'll burn out . first rule of business is never get emotional about stock , clouds the judgment . where do we stand ?
... we have 37.2 million invested . at this point , we're up 3.1 million and some change . if it goes to 75 bucks we can clean close to 12 mill .	you're walking between the raindrops kid . I expect Sir Larry is choking on his royal chamber pot by now .
my firm needs your signature on these option agreements tonight , sir , otherwise we could take a real bath tomorrow .	... Can't it wait ? I'm good for it . ... Awright . come out , get the directions from Natalie and hurry up .
sorry , Mr. Gekko .	allright . wait here ...
I guess I'll head back ...	"stick around ... Larry , one of my "" gang "" -- Bud Fox ."
the break up value is higher . it's worth 80 .	but we don't want to be greedy now , so let's let him have it at $ 72 .
""" all warfare is based on deception ... "" Sun Tzu says , If your enemy is superior , evade him , if angry , irritate him , if equally matched , fight ... if not , split and reevaluate ."	you're learning , sport ...
money never sleeps pal . when I came in in' 69 , they traded six hours a day , now the clock don't stop , London's deregulated , the Orient is hungrier than us . just let the money circle the world , sport , buying and selling , and if you're smart it comes back paying . I just made $ 800,000 in Hong Kong gold . it's been wired to you -- play with it . you done good , but you gotta keep doing good . I showed you how the game works , now school's out .	Mr. Gekko , I'm there for you 110 % .
"you don't understand . I want to be surprised ... astonish me , sport , new info , don't care where or how you get it , just get it ... My wife tells me you put a move on Darien . here's some inside info for you . that Euroflash GQ guy she's going with's got big bucks but he's putting her feet to sleep . exit visas are imminent . so don't lose your place in line . oh , jeez , I wish you could see this . the lights coming up over the water . I've never seen a painting that captures the beauty of the ocean at this moment . ... an old Russian proverb - "" a fisherman always sees another fisherman from afar . "" I like you sport , I ever tell you that ... Gordon , call me Gordon from now on ."	... Gordon .
got him at an auction in Kentucky .	how much ?
mixed emotions , Buddy : like Larry Wildman going off a Cliff in my new Maserati . men as smart as myself have got their asses handed to them on a sling with the airlines , fuel could go up , unions are killers ...	yeah aren't you forgetting something Gordon : rule one , capital reserves . this company has $ 75 million cash in an overfunded pension . that buys us a lot of credibility ... ... and the beauty is you already own close to two percent of this sucker ...
Gordon what I want--and I never asked you for anything--is to be your co-pilot on this . I want to take this airline , turn it around , and make it work . it's gonna make us a fortune !	I'm talking to a stockbroker who wants to run an airline . it's gonna take me two years and 2000 headaches to turn Teldar Paper around , what do I need this dink airline for ? I'm up to my ass in more nuts than a fruitcake .
Gordon , I worked at Bluestar , I know my way around , I have friends there ... inside .	what does that mean ?
the three unions . it's 43 % of Bluestar's operating budget , the hourly cost of a flight crew is $ 850 an hour , that's the real hidden value G.G. , if you can negotiate that out , get a crew down to $ 350-400 an hour a run , this airline is gonna be the hottest thing since Texas Air ...	what makes you think you can ?
I can talk to these people Gordon , they trust me ... and my father can be a big help in getting cuts .	alright ... Susan , get Buckingham on the box . I want him to look at it . and tell Jock Taylor at Thwick , Jensen ... So sport , the falcon has heard the falconer ... tell me more ...
and I'd like to introduce you to Mr. Gekko , and his lawyer , Mr. Salt .	a pleasure to meet you , Mr. Fox .
now , wait a minute , Dad ...	sure . what's worth doing is worth doing for money . it's a bad bargain where nobody gains . and if this deal goes through , we all gain .
I didn't know we had a meeting schedule for this morning .	I'm sorry , this can't wait .
what the hell do you want ?	I found out about the garage sale down at Bluestar . why ?
maybe you ought to read him Pinocchio . you told me you were going to turn Bluestar around . not upside down . you used me .	you're walking around blind without a cane , sport . a fool and his money are lucky to get together in the first place .
why do you need to wreck this company ?	because it's wreckable . I took another look and I changed my mind .
if these people lose their jobs , nowhere to go . my father worked at Bluestar for twenty-four years . I gave' em my word .	it's all about bucks , kid , the rest is conversation ... Bud , you're still going to be president . and when the time comes , you'll parachute out a rich man . with the money you're going to make , your father won't have to work another day in his life .
tell me , Gordon--when does it all end ? how many yachts can you waterski behind ? how much is enough ?	buddy , it's not a question of enough . it's a zero sum game , sport . somebody wins and somebody loses . money itself isn't lost or made , it's simply transferred from one perception to another . like magic . that painting cost $ 60,000 10 years ago . I could sell it today for $ 600,000 . the illusion has become real . and the more real it becomes , the more desperately they want it . Capitalism at its finest .
how much is enough Gordon ?	the richest one percent of this country owns half the country's wealth : 5 trillion dollars . one third of that comes from hard work , two thirds of it comes from inheritance , interest on interest accumulation to widows and idiot sons and what I do -- stock and real estate speculation . it's bullshit . ninety percent of the American people have little or no net worth . I create nothing ; I own . we make the rules , Buddy , the news , war , peace , famine , upheaval ; the cost of a paper clip . we pull the rabbit out of the hat while everybody else sits around their whole life wondering how we did it ... ... you're not naive enough to think we're living in a democracy are you , Buddy ? it's the free market . you're one of us now ... take advantage of it . you got the killer instinct , kid , stick with me . I got things to teach you ...
obviously ...	believe me , Buddy , I was gonna discuss this with you at the right time . look , why don't you calm down and come to the apartment for dinner tonight . bring Darien ...
... I can't make it tonight .	are you with me Buddy ?
Gordon , it's two minutes to close . what do you want to do ? ! decide .	dump it .
hello Bud .	Gordon .
Fox , Bud D. is this deja vu or has it really been a year . you're not hitting me up for NYU are you ?	well we're thinking of putting up a statue of you in the subway . I hear you're moving up in the world . an associate already . not bad . how's Margie ?
can't complain . got a house in oyster Bay . market treating you good ? still seeing that sexy French gal ?	nah , she asked the wrong question .
what was that ?	""" what are you thinking ? "" ... that was it . the hours are hell , but the money's starting to tumble in . I know this guy who's got an iron- clad way to make money , I can't lose and I can't get hurt ."
"so , does "" this guy "" have a tip for an honest lawyer ?"	yeah , check out Teldar Paper , it's still not over .
okay .	what about you , I hear you guys are handling the Fairchild foods merger and it may not be going through . any surprises I haven't read about in the Wall Street Journal ?
come on Buddy , you wouldn't want to got me disbarred now would you ?	who's listening ? it's just one college buddy talking to another .
yeah , right ...	relax , Roger , everybody's doing it but you don't know , you don't know .
... and if I did , what's in it for moi ?	more money than you ever dreamed , Roger . and the thing is no one gets hurt ... how bout a beer ?
too much to do ... but I'll walk you out .	... and you don't have to put up a dime , Roger .
so what's the problem ?	... got a strange call from the SEC . they asked to see my records ... Bud , this is a heavy ...
.... Relax Roget You're 82M in the account numbers and I'm the Invisible Man ... they're always looking for red flags , Gekko's always getting checked by them , they never come up with anything ... we're invulnerable on this ...	alright ... I just wanna slow down Bud ... no more calls for awhile , no lunches ... we suspend our business , alright ...
Gekko asked us into the Bluestar deal . we're reviewing the timetables , wanna come ?	he never told me ...
hello Bud , I'm Lisa , a friend of Gordon's .	Lisa . Gordon ? oh , Mr. Gekko . sure . would you , uh , like to come in ?
like ? uh ... hmmm . well ...	I got this guy who should know tells me buy Hewlitt Packard but I been burned on tips . what do you think Bud ?
so you're hot on this stock ?	it's ready to take off . I'd jump all over it if I were you .
sure , and I'm never gonna die either , is this one of your chain letter schemes or do I gotta buy a door to door cosmetic franchise in Northern Arkansas ?	no , no Dixon , my client wants to buy a large , large block of stock and needs to spread it around . I'll park some money in your account and if it hits , you get a big cut . I'm telling you , this is the easiest money you ever made ...
... this guy who said he was from the Security Exchange Commission , whatever the hell that is , calls and wants to ask me about that stock I bought ...	what'd you tell him ?
I told him I was in the bathroom and I'd call him right back . what the hell was I supposed to say Buddy , you got me into ...	look Dixon , calm down ! it's not illegal to buy stock or to be right . and it's not all that unusual to be spot checked on a big buy . tell him you did your homework and you thought the stock was a sound investment .
what if he asks where I got the money ?	tell' em your father gave it to you .
what if they call him ?	they won't . that's not their jurisdiction .
you sure ?	yes ! read the Constitution , it's all in there . and remember--you don't know anything , nothing .
I don't know anything !	good . then call him back . and call me back . don't worry .
hello , Natalie , you recognize the voice ? I'll give you a hint , you're thinking seriously about marrying me ...	what are you doing here ?
... And you're even lovelier than I pictured . I brought a birthday present for Mr. Gekko .	first of all , Mr. Fox , you can't just come barging in here . and what makes you think it's his birthday ?
it's in the bible , see . you better go buy him a present . please , Natalie . let me give him the gift ; Cuban cigars--Davidoff , his favorite and hard to get .	stay here , I'll see what I can do .
... thanks Natalie .	... have a nice day Mr. Stone . ... Mr. Gekko , the conference call is ready . Mr. Sugarman and Mr. Lorenzo in Delaware . Mr. Bernard in Los Angeles . Mr. Jackson and Ms. Rosco in London . they're all on .
... looks like you grown another inch ... but you don't look so hot , getting bags under your eyes , starting to look old like me .	ah , I had a tough day . some jerk D.K'd me and I gotta cover his loss .
speak English will ya .	D.K. -- didn't know -- who I was when the options he bought took a bath . he reneged on me .
I told you not to go into that racket . you could've been a doctor or a lawyer ,	coulda been a contender .
you coulda stayed at Bluestar and been a supervisor in instead of going customer relations by now ,' stead of going off and bein' a salesman .	look Dad , I'm not a salesman . how many times I gotta tell you I'm an account executive , and pretty soon I'm going to the investment banking side of the firm .
you get on the phone and ask strangers for their money , right ? you're a salesman .	Dad , it takes time . you gotta build a customer list . I'm doing it . I could make more money in one year as a broker than five years at the airline .
I don't get it , you get a scholarship to NYU , you get 35,000 the first year , and 50 last year , where the hell is it ?	50 K don't get you to first base in the Big Apple , Dad , not any more . I pay 40 % in taxes , I got a rent of 15,000 , I got school loans , car loans , food , park my car costs me 3 bills a month , I need good suits , that's $ 500 a pop , shoes ...
so come home and live rent free ,' stead of that cockroach palace you live in . $ 50,000 Jesus Christ , the world is off its rocker . I made $ 37,000 last year and you ...	it's Queens , Dad and a 5 % mortgage and you rent the top room--I gotta live in Manhattan to be a player , Dad . there's no nobility in poverty anymore , y'know . one day you're going to be proud of me , you'll see ...
it's yourself you've got to be proud of , Huckleberry , how much ya need ?	can you spare three hundred ? pay you back next month , promise .
... Got a 100 on me , you ...	not in here Dad ... please . later .
... it adds up Buddy , 300 here , 200 there . your brother never ... ... well , I always said money is something you need in case you don't die tomorrow ...	how's Mom ?
... same , pain in the ass , god bless her , talks too much ... gonna take her to Florida next month ... west coast , near Tampa , like to get out for good , but can't afford it .	... work okay ?
... this drug testing is driving my guys nuts . I got flagged for my blood pressure pills . the only good news is , we just met with the comptroller over some union stuff ...' member that crash last summer ? and the investigation ? well , the FAA is gonna rule it was a manufacturing flaw in the door latch mechanism . I kept telling' em it wasn't maintenance , it was those goddamn greedy manufacturers out in Cincinnati . and I was right .	that's great Dad .
damn right , it gets us out from under suspension . we'll get those new routes to Pittsburgh and Boston and the equipment we need . we're gonna compete with the big boys now .	hey to Bluestar , as your broker all I can advise is hold on to that stock Dad ...
you sure about this FAA announcement ?	about what ?
the FAA announcement .	sure I'm sure . buddy , you got that mischievous look in your eyes . you used to smile just like that when you were a baby sleeping , just like that .
what brings you out here ...	client . got a private jet over at Butler Aviation ... Dad , you always gotta light up when you see me , it's the ...
don't start , alright .	alright . why so pissed ?
sure ... lots of guys at the track talk like that ... but how do you know you'll have any dough next month ... What's this ? I gave you two hundred .	Dividend . I figure I owe you about five thousand in nickels and dimes ...
... don't be crazy . put it to your school loans .	don't worry about the loans . I'm doing good Dad and it's gonna stay that way now ... least buy yourself a new suit .
problem with money is you never have enough or you got too much -- and when you got it you're never happy' cause somebody's always trying to take it away from you . money's one giant pain in the ass y'ask me ... thanks .	... Dad , you should've been a CEO . how about dinner ?
whatever night you like .	wait ... next week's booked . let me check with my girl and get back to you on Monday .
yeah , you do that huckleberry . I'll still be here .	... gotta run Dad . you stop smoking , you hear ?
he's got your prick in his back pocket , son , and you're standing naked in the display window of Macy's . he's using you . only you're too blind to see it .	no , what I see is a jealous old machinist who can't stand that his son's become more successful than himself .
what you see , son , is a man who never measured success by the size of a man's wallet .	that's because you never had the guts to go out into the world and stake your claim .
your responsibility , Dad , is to present the facts , not your opinions , to the men ... you're gonna destroy their lives , Dad ! don't do it to' em . give it a chance . let the membership decide for themselves , Dad . please .	I'll be damned that when my men come to me tomorrow morning , wanting to know what's going on , I'm going to lie to them !
your words , not mine ...	you speak for me , son .
another cup of coffee ?	no , thanks , I'm nervous enough .
I guess it's time to hit the road .	yeah , don't want to be late for my own funeral .
Dad , I'm going to jail and you know it .	maybe that's the price , Bud , maybe so . it's gonna be rough on you but maybe in some screwed up way , that's the best thing that can happen to you ... stop trading for the quick buck and go produce something with your life , create , don't live off the buying and selling of others ...
I gotta feeling we're going to make a killing today , Marv .	yeah , where's your machine gun .

I was up all night charting these stocks . you want to see this or what ?	looks bearish to me , buddy . you got it all upside down . okay , I'm giving this to you and you alone ,' cause I feel sorry for you . take the Knicks against the Bullets , and my pick of the day -- Duke to beat the spread against Wake Forest .

I'm concerned about the driver of the rig .	what rig ?
Naa , fuck this , this is nothing . oh , Lord -- this just got &lt; u &gt; Big &lt; / u &gt; . I see it -- &lt; u &gt; Big &lt; / u &gt; -- Big for &lt; u &gt; you &lt; / u &gt; and big for &lt; u &gt; me &lt; / u &gt; .	what are you talking about ?

what are you saying ...	well , darlin' &lt; u &gt; I &lt; / u &gt; ain't your confessor . tell him you've got some info on the President's sex scandal , it's on your conscience , believe me , he'll drop what he's doing . okay ; &lt; u &gt; Now &lt; / u &gt; : folks , folks , folks , this is a shitty business , and it needs no Ghost Come From the Grave to tell us that . but in Six Days , Lord willing n'Jesus Tarries , I am going to take you beauties into the second term . ..... wait til you hear the speech tonight . the 3-0-3 Speech ... where's the Fad King , by the way ...
... on the way in .	when you ... What ? I'm busy .
it's the White House .	&lt; u &gt; Hello &lt; / u &gt; . what ?
what about it ?	for Schumann .
to the first LETAC engineer to go into production on prototypes .	as long as you keep overpaying me , I'll be the first to go into production on three , and four , as well .
as long as they keep overpaying me , I'll keep overpaying you . ) Just make goddam sure you can have 10 of them ready for deployment around the city by next month .	Mr. Wallace , I could have 10 of them ready by tomorrow .
do they have to look so ... robotic ?	at this stage , you either get form or function . you said she wanted function . I gave you function . what are you complaining about ?
where's John ?	performing solo . enjoying the concert so far ?
the only thing I want to hear is your silence .	I must make them very nervous if they let you out of prison . you know , we have so much in common — — we have such history together — — I've been thinking we should become friends .
you and me have nothing in common .	who else do you know who touches the world with synthetic hands ?
you ... mother ... fucker ! I'M GOING TO KILL YOU ! ! !	now , is that any way to talk to an old buddy ? I mean , just because I'm carrying around the joy of killing your family inside me doesn't mean we can't be friends .
Grimes , YOU'RE DEAD !	I'm sorry , the party you're trying to reach is not answering . is there anyone else you would like to talk to ?
dead ! you HEAR ME ?	you really are pathetic , you know that ? Mathew Grimes is only one letter in my alphabet . he is nothing compared to me .
I wouldn't pull the trigger if I were you — —	why's that ?
what C-4 ... was Cox talking about ?	let me put it to you this way ... whether I'm here ... or whether I'm not ... I'm leaving an indelible mark on the world tomorrow night .
let me put it to you this way ... whether I'm here ... or whether I'm not ... I'm leaving an indelible mark on the world tomorrow night .	where did you plant the C-4 ? !
you can't die until you tell me where the C-4 is . where is it ? !	my ... secret .
it's really too bad you have to miss the Grand Finale .	I thought you liked me being in the audience . don't you want me to see it ?
there you go — — best seat in the house .	you are going after Mayor Bennett .
let's just say I'm sending a very clear message to his re — election rally ...	aren't you going to watch with me ?
what are you talking about ?	I really did think I was still in reality . at least , until now . beam me up , Scotty !
now , is that any way to talk to an old friend ?	Barnes , YOU'RE DEAD !
you actually listen to all those tapes ?	no , I just like the effect a tape recorder has on you . how you feeling today ?
a little less than yesterday .	in other words , par for the course . how do you feel about the simulation you participated in yesterday ?
John died .	I know . I was there . I saw the whole thing . if I was your therapist , I would have advised you against putting yourself back into that kind of situation .
that's not true , Parker .	if I had died yesterday , you'd have already dissected my brain and analyzed it to see if I carry any genetic predisposition toward violence .
what was going through your mind when you killed the busboy ?	not much . he was just a computer program . nothing more .
you didn't see the expression you had on your face when you pulled the trigger . but I did . you kind of liked it , didn't you ? that thrill of going over the edge again . of taking out an innocent bystander or two , as long as you got the target ...	go to hell .
it was just like before , wasn't it ? wasn't it ? but you are making progress . instead of killing seven people to get the one you're after , this time there was only one other person involved .	enough !
I don't need a baby — sitter .	what you need is a collar .
it wasn't a lie .	every time I said it , it was . I never really thought I was going to make it .
you all right ?	fine . never felt better in my life . see , I'm a good liar .
you ready for this ?	don't worry . if I can't handle it , I'll just kill everybody .
he was re — enacting Charles Manson's LaBianca murders .	Manson didn't kill the first cops to arrive on the scene .
whoever did this wanted to do Charlie one better — — to improve upon what was already done .	Charlie ? you say that like you're close , personal friends .
I've spent over 50 hours interviewing him . Charlie killed Leno and Rosemary LaBianca because of the ugly way the members of his family had butchered Sharon Tate . after seeing the blood bath on television , he wanted to show them how it should be done . the question is , what does Charlie have to do with Sid 6.7 ?	I know who would know .
learn anything from Lindenmeyer's file ?	he had a twin brother who was a musical child prodigy who died in an electrical accident at age eight . Lindenmeyer went into an emotional shell until was 17 . all he did day and night was play the violin .
you've got a problem with me carrying a gun ?	do me one favor — — if you shoot at anything , make sure I'm nowhere near it .
what are you doing ?	checking my pulse . it's elevated . you enjoy frightening me , don't you ?
you've studied me , now I'm studying you . seems only fair , don't you think ?	this Lindenmeyer's a real piece of work .
I've been in prison , remember ?	the government must have figured there was no better person to create a psycho than a psycho .
just like they figured there was no better person to catch one ...	I am the demon from the bottomless pit ...
... here on earth to create havoc and terror . I am War , I am death . I am destruction . David Berkowitz , 1977 .	I am impressed .
for murder , though it have no tongue , will speak with most miraculous organ .	who said that ?
Hamlet . what's David Berkowitz got to do with Sid 6.7 ?	he's part of the mix . Sid 6.7 is a composite .
Lindenmeyer put increasingly complex combinations of criminal psychological profiles together to develop the ultimate villain .	creating a whole far more dangerous than the sum of its parts .
this is getting you pumped up , isn't it ? this is like the World Series to you .	as a matter of fact , it is .
remember the bowling ball bag Sid carried with him in virtual reality ?	Dahmer carried the head of one of his victims in a bowling bag for over a week . kept it in his locker while he was at work in a candy factory . we need to get a look at Sid 6.7's final profile .
what we need to do is stop playing with computers and go catch the son — of-a-bitch before he kills anybody else .	in order to find him , we have to understand what makes him tick ...
give me your wrist .	give me a goddam break . I'm not going to go anywhere alone .
why didn't you tell me you had a daughter ?	I prefer keeping my professional life separate from my personal life .
she's beautiful , you know ?	thank-you . her name is Karin .
want to tell me the real reason we stopped at your house ?	I told you , it was on the way and I wanted to change clothes .
you should practice lying more often . you're awful at it . where to ?	Sid 6.7 is no longer bound by his programming .
what does that mean ?	now that he's in the real world , there are no longer limitations on his behavior like there were in virtual reality . Sid is going to evolve .
sounds to me like a well — educated way of saying you have no idea what to do next .	what I do know is that whatever he's becoming , Sid 6.7 is going to be even worse than he was before .
I forgot what real coffee tastes like ...	you know , considering you've only been out of prison for seven hours , you're re — adapting quite well . wait , I didn't mean that the way it sounded . I meant ...
don't worry about it , all right ?	dammit , I hate sounding so clinical all the time . all I meant to say was I thought you were doing well , but then I ...
relax . I know what you meant .	I ruin so many moments by analyzing them when I should just be living them .
don't get out of the car .	stop me .
what the hell's going on ? !	this is my area of expertise .
enjoying yourself ?	you know I am .
this isn't a game , Parker !	tell him .
what's the problem ?	I'm doing the best I can !
whatever he was doing here was only the start .	start of what ?
it's not just Sid 6.7's performances that are increasing . stars need bigger and bigger audiences . whatever Sid is going to do next , it's going to involve media .	you like baseball ?
real effective security ...	you could have just flashed him your badge , you know ?
which way ?	both .
Parker - — stop ! stop ! don't make me shoot you — —	if you're gonna do it , better do it now .
Grimes is back ! he's back ! he's come back ! ! !	no ! Grimes isn't back . he's only one part of Sid . Sid 6.7 is a hell of a lot worse than Grimes ever was . get a hold of yourself !
we know you didn't kill those guards .	they're going to fry me for it , anyway .
how did you find out about the toxin ?	Sid 6.7 told me after he killed the two guards . he suggested I kill you rather than him .
you're not capable of it .	I pose an unacceptable danger to the public , remember ?
I told you before , Grimes liked to be obvious .	Sid 6.7 isn't Grimes .
if we find Sid , Lindenmeyer won't be far behind .	think he's keeping track of his creation ?
that , or living through him ...	see something ?
I'm not sure ... on the bridge ... the guy at the payphone ...	nice work .
can I ask you something ?	you mean there's something you haven't asked me ?
you've already fulfilled the terms of your pardon . you stopped Sid 6.7 and you've got his module . you're free to go — — right now . why are you going to do this ?	you don't know ?
that's why I'm asking .	because this pain — in — the — ass criminal psychology expert has helped me understand what I'm capable of . and what I'm not . and better than anyone else , I am capable of stopping Sid 6.7 .
you okay ?	... I think so ... You ?
more or less .	Lindenmeyer ?
my guess is dead .	Sid ?
how's your pulse ?	I couldn't tell you .
then shoot him already .	duck !
what do we do now ?	you won't want to watch . turn around .
don't be angry with me , Daryl .	did you recognize the son-of-a bitch who got away ?
should I have ?	think hard -- it'll come to you ...
true genius is rarely rewarded within its lifetime .	it was you , wasn't it ?
it was me , what ?	you amped the neural connectors back up , didn't you ? you're the reason the convict died . you're the reason I got fired !
I couldn't just let them make you bring down my degree of difficulty . I'm a triple-twisting , double back flip off the high platform , not a swan dive .	my God ...
which God would that be , the one who created me , or the one who created you ? in your world , the Lord giveth , and the Lord taketh away . but in my world , the one who gave me life doesn't have the balls to stop a couple of bureaucratic assholes from taking it away .	what do you expect me to do , put your character module in my pocket and just walk you out of here ?
you catching my drift ?	I think I understand what you have in mind ...
Sid — — NO ! ! !	what do you expect me to do , thank him ?
I am beautiful , aren't I ?	of course you are .
help me get out of here .	glad to ...
you made me a composite of 183 of the most vicious people who ever lived . what do you think I'm doing ?	I'm begging you ... please don't kill me ! please !
I told you this would work .. By setting back the clocks , he has absolutely no idea he's in virtual reality . he still thinks he's in the real world .	what's wrong with Parker ?
how should I know ?	show me his physical sensory level .
I wonder how that ...	turn it down !
he's developing a Hemisphere imbalance .	talk so I can understand .
if I don't adjust the level of neural information each side of his brain is receiving , he won't be able to walk when I take him out of VR .	then fix it .
hey ! ! !	show's over unless I get to see what you've been working on after hours .
I haven't been working on anything .	do I get to see it or not ?
get that fucking thing away from me !	you're ... such a wimp .
watching your VR people Auto reset gave me the idea .	it's nano — technology , isn't it ? machines the size of molecules ...
coordinated by polymer neural net .	it feels so .. .real.
it's better than real . it's synthetic flesh . synthetic blood . synthetic organs ... It's a physiological machine .	this is supposed to be years away .
as far as the public is concerned , it is . the reason you got fired , and I got my second demo into production , is I'm a lot smarter than you . I never give my best stuff away .	how do you kill it ?
amazing . I hate to say it , but it is .	I know . I'm ready to incubate something a little more advanced than a coldblooded reptile . if you want to experience the future , meet me in my office in 15 minutes . and bring the Sheila 3.2 character module with you ...
you need a maid .	what I need is a nymphomaniac .
you embarrassed me in front of the highest — ranking law enforcement official in the country . do you have any idea how much money you just cost me ?	the reason you insisted on testing my system with prisoners is because of the increased risks involved with increased realism .
I'm still making Adjustments ...	you've had a year — and — a — half to make all the Adjustments you want , Lindenmeyer . ) Elizabeth Deane does not give second chances . neither do I. You're fired .
I'M WHAT ? !	you are to turn over the Sid 6.7 program , and all its documentation , for immediate destruction . is that understood ?
how does he know who I am ?	he hears ... everything .
what did Cox pull him out early for ?	Barnes used to work for him when he was still a cop in the field , remember ?
what the hell happened ?	Lindenmeyer developed neural connectors that tap directly into the nervous system . if the simulator isn't calibrated properly , experiencing death in this level of VR is like experiencing death within a dream . the experience becomes real .
simulations are supposed to give participants practice in realistic , dangerous scenarios while protecting them from the risks they are exposed to in the real world .	I was assured the problem was corrected .
it makes me nervous just seeing him in a uniform . I will never forget the first time I saw the photos from the crime scene .	neither will the public . the media has caught wind of his pardon . unless Mr. Barnes starts giving me some tangible results , I'm going to put him back in his cage .
I watched your simulation , Mr. Barnes . very impressive . you know , you're the only one to ever go up against Sid 6.7 who is still alive .	only because I got pulled out early .
not from in here .	this is a full pardon . it authorizes your immediate release .
if Sid 6.7 hasn't killed you , we throw you back in here and you serve out the rest of your sentence .	how do you know I won't run ?
Barnes , where the hell have you been ? !	trying to find out where the bomb is . where the hell have you been ?
what did you find out ?	call off the manhunt looking for me . I didn't kill the transport guards .
it's already been called off . witnesses confirmed you weren't the shooter . did you find out where the bomb is ?	no , but I've confirmed the reelection rally is the target . how much C-4 is missing ?
enough to level an entire city block .	if I were you , I'd get every demolition team in the city searching in and around the Biltmore Hotel .
demolition teams have searched everywhere in and around the hotel . I don't know where ...	Sid is smart enough to know you'd check everywhere in the immediate area . whatever the device is , he's probably got it timed to move into position just before it detonates . have the demo teams check every subway tunnel , water pipe , gas pipe , and sewer pipe that goes under , over , or into the arena .
you know how much man power you're talking about ?	you're the highest law enforcement official in the country . use the fucking army if you need to .
this better not be a wild goose chase .	or what , you'll authorize my death a second time today ?
Ms. Deane , you wanted to see me ?	we have an emergency situation which requires somebody with expertise in criminal psychology . under the authority vested in me by the President , I'm giving you temporary re — assignment .
letting a lunatic like Parker Barnes loose in the free world is like lighting a fuse . at some point , he will go off -- you saw what happened in the simulator . the risk to the public is unacceptably dangerous .	not if you're with him every step of the way .
the man played judge , jury , and executioner with eight people's lives . he lost control and is capable of doing it again .	I understand the risks involved here . but there is nobody better qualified to go after Sid 6.7 than Barnes . and , there is nobody who knows him better than you . if a situation becomes volatile , you will find a way to quell it . I have complete confidence in you .
... illegal search of Lindenmeyer' s duplex . eleven civilian vehicles damaged or destroyed . twenty — four citizen complaints . and the calls are just starting to come in ... I forgot what it's like to have you on the streets .	any sign of Lindenmeyer ?
none . he could be hiding , he could be helping Sid , or could be in little pieces on Santa Monica beach . any idea what Sid's going to do next ?	until we know what new influences are affecting him , we can't be sure .
I should have told him .	don't blame yourself . in your shoes , I don't think I would have told Parker , either . so do you think Grimes has become the dominant personality ?
I'm not sure . my guess is that's what Sid wants us to think .	you think he's smart ?
I think we both know who did . what's so urgent ?	I need your help--
why didn't anybody tell me ? !	I don't set policy . you have the key ?
give me 30 seconds , then flip every switch you can reach .	got it .
you all right ?	why'd .. .you pull me out ?
you were supposed to act as if everything was real .	real , my ass . it's an overblown game . anybody ever catch that fucking psycho ?
before you , nobody else had gotten close enough to Sid 6.7 to take a shot at him . hell , nobody else had even been able to start tracking him before he got to them first . new scar — — you making it okay in there ?	I'm getting by .
but with the six months off I get for being your guinea pig , I've only got to survive another 17 years , 5 months , and 23 days .	don't give up , Parker . not ever .
you know those cheesy Christmas cards of your family under that tree in your back yard you keep sending me every year ?	what about them ?
Parker Barnes , I'd like you to meet Crime Czar Elizabeth Deane .	it's too early in the morning for me to be cordial . you got any coffee ?
these were taken inside LETAC an hour ago . pretty pictures , aren't they ?	I've seen worse .
Jesus Christ . can you kill it ?	if you can catch him .
she's going to help you understand what makes Sid 6.7 tick .	what she's going to do is get in my way .
she wasn't part of the deal , Cox .	fine — — you want to stay here ?
officers in Toluca Lake just found an affluent couple ... completely gutted . so were the first two cops to arrive on scene .	their weapons missing ?
Sid 6.7 is now armed .	where's my gun ?
don't worry , they have no idea where you are .	you son — of — a — bitch . how could you let them put the implant in my head ? how ?
she saved your life , Parker . she didn't have to , but she did .	then I guess we're even .
on my life , I promise you I will .	if you're lying , I'll hunt you down and kill you myself .
my first two pairs of convicts suffered the same fate .	why wasn't I told ?
you mean a nano — tech synthetic organism .	whatever .
recognize this ? how would you like your old job back ?	catch him and your record's clean .
this is the newest technology approved for general implementation . it's called a locater implant . every parolee gets one . we're going to know where you are every second for the rest of your life .	if you try to run , I'll hunt you down and kill you myself .
yes or no , Mr. Barnes ?	there's already a task force out looking for Lindenmeyer . every other officer in the city will be hunting Sid right along with you .
Madison lives two blocks from their present location .	why would they be going there ?
I wish we could hear them .	Barnes wouldn't kill two innocent guards .
he would slaughter eight people sitting in a room , but not two prison guards ?	do I need to remind you what happened to his wife ? to his daughter ? I will stake my reputation that Barnes didn't kill those guards .
can you tell us what's on the disc ?	) There is one program with approximately 1.3 million lines of programming . it is thoroughly secured , which is not surprising considering Lindenmeyer created it .
it's not your fault . we appreciate you trying .	look , I feel bad about this , so I'm going to try to look into the programming of his Maestro teaching tool for you . ) I've had one sitting around for years . maybe I can learn something that you'll find useful .
you son-of — a — bitch , I'm going to kill you .	me ? what did I do ?
I'm sorry , I thought you were somebody else .	I've discovered something about Lindenmeyer' 5 Maestro teaching tool I thought you should know ... The harm done to the music students who used the device — — it was not by accident . the machine was designed explicitly for that purpose . Lindenmeyer intended to hurt the kids using it .
hello .	hello .
good morning , Rita . how are we today ?	today , a good girl .
how did you see me ?	from the terrace .
I'm going to the hen house . are you coming with me ?	no , I don't want to .
how do you feel ?	I have a headache .
that will soon pass . it's nothing .	what happened to me ?
you fainted last night after supper . the master and I carried you here .	have I slept long ?
she has the face of an angel . what a pity you can't see her .	right , let's go . and keep the compliments to yourself . I don't like them .
what about you , Manuel ?	I'm only good at making people laugh .
that's all right ; we all laugh here , but not at you ; I'll see to that .	she looks like a sick marrow !
give the little girl to me . come here , sweetheart . are you ready ?	when you are , miss .
don't talk like that !	I'll talk the way I want to . I've had enough of this .
would you mind telling me what I did wrong to you to deserve your insults ?	I've had a gutful of this .
mother ?	I've just had a letter from your uncle . he won't be able to come when you take your vows .
I hardly know him . I saw him only once , some years ago . I can't even remember him .	in any case he's asking you to come and stay with him .
I don't want to leave the convent , Mother .	I'm afraid that his health is not good . he's your only relative and you ought to say farewell to him before taking your vows . you will certainly never see him again .
he has paid for your studies and your maintenance , and he has just sent your dowry . does that mean so little to you , Viridiana ?	I have no desire to see the world again , but if you order me to ...
good morning . you weren't expecting me , were you ?	mother .
ever since yesterday , when we heard by chance about the tragedy , we have been very anxious for you . why didn't you write ? I would have come immediately .	I had so many things to think about !
is there some grave impediment which prevents you from taking your vows ? there must be something .	I have nothing to reproach myself for . all I know is that I've changed . with all my strength , which is not much , I will follow the road that the Lord has shown me . one can also serve outside a convent .
forgive me if I have offended you .	you are forgiven . goodbye .
have you repaired the windows of the dormitories ?	they shut all right now . and the blankets are ready .
what's going on , Moncho ?	this louse is looking for trouble .
yes !	I can't do anything to make you stay ? these people annoy you , isn't that it ?
why are you crying ?	I'm afraid .
don't invent stories ; go to bed .	a black bull came .
a black bull !	it's a very big one .
yes -- very , very big !	he couldn't get through the door , then ?
he came in through the cupboard .	you little liar ! get out of here !
I'll box your ears if you don't show some respect for the dead ! you mustn't play under this tree .	don Jaime loved to watch me skip .
how do you do , Miss Viridiana !	is anything the matter , Mr. Mayor ?
why not ?	there's been an accident .
where ?	come with me .
are you sure it isn't contagious ?	they told me it isn't at the hospital .
they're varicose veins . it isn't leprosy .	I'll take him to the doctor tomorrow . come on now , sit down and go on eating . and you , look after him as if he were a sick brother . be understanding . now finish eating and then go to bed . everyone in bed by eight o'clock !
how are you today ?	things seem to be getting better .
are your parents alive ?	parents ? nobody cares a damn , what's the use of them !
don't say that .	right , I won't say that , but I still think they're no use .
you'll soon find out , you liar !	stop this !
it's for people !	then let him go and he'll follow you .
he's good at rabbiting and he knows it . when we're in the country , if he doesn't hunt he doesn't get fed .	how much do you want for him ?
what's he called ?	Canelo !
Miss Viridiana ...	are you Jorge ?
Jorge , Don Jaime's son , at your service .	I've been expecting you ; I got a letter from the lawyer .
it's about time we spoke to each other , isn't it ?	well ... is it so urgent ?
I don't know anything about these things , Jorge ...	but you have a right to let us know what you think .
I know that you used to work with an architect .	and do you know that my mother and I had to suffer ? if my father had bothered himself a little more about us , I'd be an architect now .
I don't understand how you can like being alone so much .	I'm not like you , you have your wife .
what are you doing here ? get out .	leave him alone .
you won't get much done with those people . those times are over ! you ought to let me kick them out .	do they worry you that much , then ?
I know perfectly well how little I can do . what I want to do is give passing Beggars a roof , some food , and a bit of human warmth .	is that all you're going to devote your life to ?
are they going to work here too ?	don't worry . nobody's going to disturb you .
don't forget the meeting with the lawyer . the car will pick you up tomorrow morning .	I'll be ready .
yes . why ?	you can come and live again in the big house if you want . now that I'm alone , I can settle down anywhere .
and ... your friend ?	she's left .
is she coming back ?	no .
why ?	he was very good . better than some people would think .
why did he kill himself ?	I don't know , sir .
I don't know ; I can't remember . but I'm sure he loved you .	why ?
you wouldn't be here otherwise .	these chairs are in good condition . with a little varnish and some new covers this one will be quite presentable .
I don't know -- they've always been there .	that's stupid ! plaster ! it can still be used .
if you free me , you'll be a rich man ...	me , rich ? come on !
I don't want you to untie me . kill him and then I'll give you the money .	where's the dough ?
that will teach you not to bother me any more , you son of a bitch .	not in that way ; you're always looking for company .
what's the matter with you ?	nothing .
why the bad temper ?	it's Viridiana . she's getting on my nerves .
she's mad .	no , not mad at all : she's rotten with religion .
so , Ramona !	run and get something to mop it up with , quickly .
if you wake first , wake me up .	what are you going to do ?
what I do every day , but I want to do it earlier .	you're happy , aren't you !
shouldn't I be ? you , on the other hand ...	I'm bored . I'm alone all day and I don't know what to do .
that your cousin is more to your taste .	she isn't my cousin .
how in hell does it wind up ?	I think I'd better go tomorrow .
don't be a fool ! why rush away from something which couldn't happen ?	you see how much you like her ?
me ?	come on , miss . just so the Virgin can be really pretty .
it won't take but a minute . it's a votive offering for a lady who was cured just when she was dying of fever . our Lady of the helpless granted her a favor .	do you have great devotion for the Virgin ?
thank you ; but it's missing something .	that doesn't matter ; I like it .
my God , what have you done to him !	he was asking for it .
Ramona ! Ramona !	quiet , my dove . quiet , or I'll ...
how much is that ?	fifteen yards .
that's fifteen by seven ?	that's it .
have you thought of what you want planted yet ?	the fields have been left so long ; with a good manuring anything will grow .
it's for wheat . we've always grown maize in the strip above the vegetables .	and in the vegetable plot ?
hold on , Ramon ! is there time to make another trip ?	no , sir , it's nearly six o'clock . okay , let's get a move on ! when are you leaving ?
tonight , but I'll be back tomorrow afternoon .	what will the lady say ?
she won't even know .	if everybody agrees , but to make a roast takes four hours .
is it all right ?	yes .
they told us you'd be back tomorrow ...	I didn't want to do it , Don Jorge . they made me ...
leave me now . you can go to bed .	yes , sir . good night .
why don't you ask her to stay on for a few days ?	I have asked her but she's ungrateful . sometimes I feel like hitting her . when I talk to her about the convent , she turns to stone .
sit down , I'm going to need your help .	what's the matter ?
I'd be really ungrateful , if I didn't like you , sir ; you took me and my little girl in when I didn't know where to turn .	yes , yes , but there's no need to bring that up . how far are you prepared to help me ?
just say the word , sir , and I'll do anything .	why don't you speak to her , Ramona ? women are good at that sort of thing . think of something that will make her stay a few more days . you are kind , Ramona ! speak to her . I know I don't need to offer you anything , but , if you're successful in this , I'll not forget you or your little girl .
but sir , what can I say to her ? and why should she pay any attention to what a servant tells her ?	the way she looked at me , Ramona ! she hates me now . I think I've made a great mistake . she's going away , she's going away and nothing will stop her .
speak to her again . explain everything to her seriously .	what for ? she'll only look at me that way again ... I couldn't . you go . perhaps she'll listen to you . try to convince her .
but what can I say to her , sir ?	tell her I lied , that I didn't take advantage of her .
you believe me , don't you ?	yes , sir .
don't lie . you don't believe me either .	it's only that ... It's all very odd , sir .
yes , Uncle . how are you ?	I'm well ... The bus was late , wasn't it ? ... What was the journey like ?
excellent . what a charming , peaceful place , Uncle .	you'll think you're still at the convent .
how long are you staying ?	a very short while , Uncle . I've been given permission to stay only a few days .
was that difficult to get ?	no . mother Superior told me to come .
did you have so little interest in seeing me ?	to tell you the truth , not very much . I cannot lie . I respect you and I am grateful to you because I owe you everything materially , but otherwise ...
you have no feelings toward ...	no .
you've been neglecting the farm , Uncle .	in twenty years the grass has invaded everything . there are spiders all over the house except on the first floor . I hardly ever go out .
who is she ?	my maid Ramona's daughter . she's a little animal .
come down .	how like your aunt you are , even in your walk .
I know , Uncle , you've told me that already .	you see , even the voice .
I'm going to make you a nun's cake . it will make your mouth water .	you are spoiling me too much . I won't know what to do with myself when you've gone .
only because you want it .	what do you mean ?
how did you know about that ?	oh , some years ago I heard my mother talking about it . but is it true ?
yes , it is .	don't you ever see him ?
never .	how could anybody behave like that ?
sometimes these things happen because of inexperience . sometimes it's because of ...	evil .
his mother wanted to keep him . she came from a poor family . I was in love with your aunt . I would like to have acknowledged him but I was afraid of losing her . that's why I didn't say anything .	and this innocent child .
thank you , Uncle .	this evening we must do something special by way of a farewell .
whatever you like .	I should like you to do something for me . it's an innocent sort of thing but I'm very set on it .
how strange you are ! when I asked you to do this favor for me you refused . you seemed almost offended . and now , here you are , making me so very happy all of a sudden . thank you , my child !	I don't like masquerading , but as you see I decided to give in to your whim .
you must think I'm mad .	no , Uncle , and now I'm pleased to have been able to do this favor , because , although I didn't think so at first , you are really a good man .
if you only knew ... When I was young I was full of idealism . I wanted to do something on a big scale for others , something to show my great love for humanity . but as soon as I tried to do something about it , I became afraid that I would be laughed at and I felt like a fool ... and so I went back into my shell .	wasn't that cowardice ?
Uncle , you mustn't think that I won't be sad to leave you .	it's up to you entirely . don't leave , then ...
unfortunately ...	it's my fault . if I'd come to see you more often , if I'd invited you here for holidays , maybe everything would be different .
yes , I don't want you ever to leave this house .	you must be out of your mind . I've been so happy these last few days -- now you've spoiled it all .
leave us alone , Ramona .	don't go !
you're lying .	no , it's true . last night when you were sleeping , I had you all to myself .
think about it . don't hurry . think it over .	go away ! leave me alone .
let me pass !	you must listen to me before you go .
I've listened to you long enough . let me out .	all that I said just now was a lie . I said it so you wouldn't leave . I only molested you in my thoughts ... I can't bear to have you leave me , hating me like this . tell me you believe what I'm saying and I'll let you go .
you disgust me ... even if what you say is true .	then you won't forgive me ?
two .	are there many windows ?
lots . it's got balconies and two big towers .	then it's a respectable house .
when I wasn't so miserable I used to sell pigs . begging your pardon , I was more honest than my holy Mother .	so you didn't come from the poorhouse !
no , miss . smoking makes him spit and feel ill .	smoking makes me feel ill ? it's these filthy fag ends . I won't mention in this company what's upsetting you .
they've got a real hen house here ! you can't hear yourself speak .	tell me the answer to this ! what bird lays eggs in a barn ?
what's that ?	Enedina and Paco ...
what about them ?	they're playing games behind the couch ...
which couch ?	that one .
take me there .	really , Don AMALIO , there's not much point in making a fuss .
I'll come to you tonight .	no , the children sleep with me .
give them to Refugio .	no , I don't want to because they yell . and I've got news for you too .
you'd like me to kill them ?	didn't you say you know how to make vanilla pudding ?
stop this , stop this .	let me go , Don Amalio , I'll tear her apart .
where's the camera ?	it's a present from my parents .
good times .	drum banging real times .
she's dead .	it was an accident !
fucking desert .	fish , I'm really sorry . I just ... I owe you man . desert .
right .	that's right .
shut up Micheal .	I KILLED MY BROTHER !
you see for me it's over . over baby . I'm gonna turn myself in . after the wedding of course . after the wedding . out of respect .	I don't think that's a good idea .
I love it . I just love , love , love , love it .	are you guys gonna fill this place with kids ? you sure got room for them .
we're in no hurry . I think we'll take some time to enjoy each other , enjoy our freedom before we surrender ourselves to kids .	take your time . I wish I had .
we will .	so where to on the honeymoon ?
smart . smart . smart . think big picture , take your time . I wish I had .	that's our plan .
well , I just need your signature on these contracts and a deposit check so I can get the ball rolling .	... We will compare these before photos with whatever form of degeneration presented to us in 24 hours , no matter how low , how vile ...

I told her that I have no idea what Adam was talking about in that letter .	did she believe you ?
I have no idea .	you can tell when people believe you . it's obvious .

why did you forget the tent check ?	I didn't mean to Liz . I'm sorry .
you can't play around with these tent people .	I'm not playing around . I forgot .
what else have you forgot ?	how could I know what else I forgot ?
I'm working my ass off here . I've taken care of absolutely everything Keith .	because you wanted to . you wanted this to be your wedding not your parent's .
don't you dare .	what ?
don't you put this on me . don't do it , don't do it , don't do it , don't ...	stop it . I'm sorry .
you know how important this is to my mother . you know that .	I'm sorry . I'm sorry I forgot the tent . I don't think I forgot anything else .
I bet you didn't forget the bachelor party checks .	are we going to do this again ?
I'm just saying I bet those checks all found the mailboxes .	I wouldn't know .
it amazes me how organized you and your little fun bunch can be when it comes time to mobilize to Vegas .	they organized this , not me . I have nothing to do with it .
well it's bad timing .	how do you figure ?
right before the wedding ?	it's a bachelor party . you sort of have to do it before the wedding .
I suppose Boyd is the creative force behind all this .	he is .
he's a moron .	he's my friend . he's not a moron .
why do you feel the need to explore this side of your personality ?	what are you talking about ?
I'm talking about the kind of people you hang out with ... about growing up , assuming responsibility of yourself .	I asked you to marry me . I'm ready for marriage . that's responsibility . that's growth .
I just think that at some point you're going to have to re-evaluate some of your friendships ...	who else ?
Charles Moore for instants .	you don't like Moore ? since when ?
it's not that I don't like him . but the wedding has really got me thinking and ... I just keep myself opening up . Crowning . and I want you keeping up with me here .	what does Moore have to do with your growing ?
I just don't see him in the big picture .	I've known him since Cub Scouts .
he's weird .	he's quiet .
he's weird .	he just doesn't talk a lot .
why ? what's his problem ?	he's a great chef .
he's weird . and I expect more from you .	you expect more what ?
"you're going to be hungover for three days . like those guys on "" Oprah "" that get drunk and have disgusting sex with prostitutes and then say their vows with the stench of cheap hotel whore sex all over them ."	time out .
it's vile !	that's absurd .
I've seen it on television .	I'm not going to marry you with the smell of prostitutes on my body .
I am not common Keith . I am not common . I am a creature like no other and I will not be commoned ! is that to much to ask ? is that to much to ask ! ? !	you will not be common ! ! !
do you love me ?	of course .
how much ?	with all my heart .
problems ?	seating problems .
okay .	Keith do not trivialize this .
I'm not . what's the problem ?	we're supposed to have gold-trimmed padded seats , now they're telling me that there was a mistake and we can't have padded .
what kind of seats can we have ?	not padded ones .
so what do we do ?	you go down there .
go down where ?	go down to the seat place and straighten this out .
honey I don't have the time ...	I need your help .
we're leaving in three hours .	I need your help .
I'll call them from the road .	do you love me ?
more than I ever imagined being able to love anyone ever .	take care of those chairs .
we're leaving from Adam's . come send me off .	maybe .
will you please call the chair people ?	I will .
do you love me ?	of course .
just call and let me know that your okay .	I love you .
hello .	hi .
hi . are you calling from jail ?	not yet .
well , the night is young . did you straighten out the chair situation ?	I'm working on it , I've made three calls . I can't stop thinking about how much I love you .
well I do .	well you should .
what are you doing ?	just a bit of organizing .
nesting ?	yeah . nesting .
I'm mad at you .	go have fun . not too much .
hello .	hey . it's me .
where are you ?	we're on our way home . I just ... we're running a little late .
how late ?	no . just like an hour or so .
okay .	what okay ?
what !	the chairs .
I left a message . I think it's going to be okay .	you sound funny . did you do cocaine ?
what's the word on the chairs ?	I'm working on it .
""" Darli ... ing you , ewe ewe ewe , send me , Darli ... ing you , ewe ewe ewe , mend me ."	""" at first I thought it was infatuation ... But oh it's lasted so long ... """
after the wedding , which we're paying for ourselves , and this house ...	yeah baby . everything's great .
well , can you come back inside ?	yeah . sure .
now ?	yeah . look honey , I'll be right in . I just ... we're just taking care of some groomsmen last minute business .
everything's OK . just some more preparations .	are they fighting ?
cancel ? ! cancel ? ! are you out of your fucking mind ? !	nobody's saying cancel . I'm talking about modifying .
no way .	can we just talk this out ?
Lois is a mess and Micheal's really upset . everyone's upset .	we're not canceling .
I know .	I won't even discuss it .
I need you to pick up the cake tomorrow .	don't we already have someone to do that for us ?
yeah . you .	okay . okay .
that means we get five hundred thousand to help raise the kids .	no .
it's okay ... It's okay baby . cry for Mama . cry for Mama .	no it's not okay . it's not .
Liz we've got to cancel , we have to put it off .	don't even .
do you love me ?	what ?
do you love me ?	what kind of stupid question is that ?
oh God . we . Liz . we . we . killed a woman . we ...	what are you talking about ?
oh Liz . we . God . we , in Vegas . Micheal crushed her skull . she was dead . there was nothing else to do . it was an accident .	who's dead ?
the prostitute .	you fucked a prostitute ?
no Micheal did . it was an accident .	you killed a prostitute .
Micheal , by accident .	call the police .
it's too late .	my God . you've got to call the police , tell them it was an accident . where is she ?
she's in the desert . she's out in the desert .	you left a dead prostitute out in the desert ? alone ?
she's not alone ... She's ... Boyd ... Oh God ... He's gone nuts ... He killed Lois and Micheal ... it's all ...	stop ! you stop right here . I don't want to know anymore . I told you not to do this bachelor Party thing . you were warned .
but ...	no buts . I told you your friends were Jackasses .
but ...	no buts . I've waited twenty-seven years , twenty-seven years I have focused and prepared to walk down that aisle . I will not be derailed ! I will not be embarrassed ! I will not be denied ! I am walking down that aisle tomorrow come hell or high fucking water !
he kept saying he was protected .	what does that mean ?
like if something happened to him , he could still get us .	like how ?
the only proof is those bodies .	so what do we do ?
move the bodies .	move the bodies ?
I ... Liz ... all I ever wanted , was for you to be happy . I just wanted to give you the wedding , the life you always dreamed of ... ... I just love you so much ... So much ...	you and Moore move the bodies and bury Boyd with them . in fact , put Moore in the ground too .
if you don't tie up all the loose ends it'll never be over .	no ...
you put him down or don't bother coming back .	but ...
do you love me ? do YOU LOVE ME ? !	yea ... It's great ... seems like ... I don't know you've got all the important stuff in there .
all right then . it's refreshing to see two young people not afraid of real commitment . will you have friends or family saying words - singing or anything ?	are we supposed to ?
may we have the rings please ?	what ?
these rings represent the commitment Fisher and Liz make to each other on the day . Fisher do you take Liz to be your beloved wife , to respect , honor and cherish till death do you part ?	I do .
the hell I did !	the hell you didn't !
the hell I did !	you said one in two marriages end in divorce .
Nope .	Moore ?
you hate women .	false .
true .	not true .
you have a King fantasy .	I am a lover . in Africa , you can stay king as long as you can service your women every night .
and what happens when you can't ?	new king .
if I'm the king of Israel , I say to myself , King , I say to myself , King ... Take a good look around . what do I see ?	Israel doesn't have a King .
then what do they have ?	they have a president . a Benjamin Yahoo something .
I say to myself , look at the map . look what's all around you . people who wish bad bad things for you and your people . for thousands of years the Jews are fighting everybody . it used to be they'd throw rocks , then the iron revolution and they would attack with spears . then the gunpowder revolution . now they're shooting fire power back and forth , all day bullets flying , babies getting shot .	what's your point ?
the Israelis can protect themselves . they got the Mossad thing happening . Mossad's for real , man . they scalp babies .	there's my point exactly .
what ? what's your point ?	take Mexico .
what ?	lock up the chickens , dig up the holy dirt , pack up the wailing crying wall thing they bang their heads on all day long , stick it all on a big fucking tug boat . the whole country picks up and takes Mexico .
the Mexicans would love it . they're dying for a little order down there . they need direction .	they need leadership .
a little gut check time fellas . a time for some serious self-exploration . how do I function ? for real ? no more bullshit . can I keep my cool when they bounce my bananas ? when they won't play my fucking song ? etc , etc . do you get me ? do you get me ?	not really , no .
oh that's just nothing . that's just a missing persons thing , that's all .	you said nobody would miss her .
this is going to stop right now . right now !	you will not screw this up .
the need to know is clear . what did Adam tell Lois ? that's the name of the game . what did Adam tell Lois ? what does Lois know ?	ball park sausages .
you want some breakfast meat . Micheal . is that what you want ?	"Franco Harris has a flare for the dramatic . the former Pittsburgh Steeler running back , beat known for "" The Immaculate reception , "" his improbable sixty yard Ricochet reception . I say Ricochet reception has made a bold move on corporate America . Harris has lead a group of investors in the purchase of the Park sausage Company . by taking on the challenge of resurrecting Park's , Harris is engaged in the equivalent of a sudden death overtime ."
easy Micheal .	he must take an open-field run to profitability through excessive debt large competitors and dwindling market share . before the clock runs out .
we're goosed .	we're not goosed .
we're goosed ! Goosed by God !	Micheal get a grip . what did you tell her ?
stop it !	Goosed !
stop .	Goosed !
how about my Fatburger ?	come on tough guy . listen to me . you are going to tell Lois that it was all an accident . okay cowboy ? you got me ?
you said that Boyd .	well , I didn't mean it .
Tony ? this is Keith Fisher . you're doing my wedding and I'm calling about the chair situation . yeah , I'll hold .	who's up for making some real money ?
prison Communication Systems . an acquaintance friend of mine is professionally involved with a communications outfit in Denver that I just happen to know for a fact is about to be rewarded a very large , exclusive contract to rewire every state prison in Colorado . yes sir .	no , I'm holding for Tony . in chairs . Keith Fisher . okay .
that would translate to government guaranteed contract in excess of 35 million dollars .	we need padded chairs .
oh , Jesus ... call the police .	no .
she's dead . call somebody !	shut up .
call 911 .	shut up .
fuck ! fuck you fucking guys !	well we can definitely call the police . that's an easy call . if we call the police ... What happens ? they find a dead prostitute in the bathroom ... They ask us ... What happened ? we say , ah ... our friend , Micheal ... Your brother ... got a little out of control ... they were making love ... and he got a little excited ... and he , ah , sort of beat her head into the side of a toilet , while he choked her to death with a rubber hose ...
oh God . this is insane .	what's insane is the fact that Micheal here put a fucking girl's head through a toilet . that's insane .
all right people . new plan . not even a new plan so much as a modification of the old plan .	I'm calling the police .
that is a load of shit . personal power has nothing to do with any of this . Tony Robbins has helped me to unlock energy and see my options more clearly , yes , but to give him credit for this , for all of this ... Well that's just more than the man deserves .	I think we should say some words over the grave .
what kind of words ?	I'm talking about prayer .
no , this is the perfect time . this is real time . Adam . your brother and I , as well as several others present , have always suspected that you ... ... are a fully repressed , living in major denial , locked down , fly-boy butt-fucker .	"it goes ; "" Today is the first day of the rest of our lives . """
Fisher had a less than normal relationship with that donkey .	you always were a jealous man .
the problem was our quarterback had trouble remembering his right from left ...	no , the problem , as I recall , was the lack of blocking ...
OK . definitely not cool ! definitely inappropriate behavior here .	shut up Boyd .
negative . this is not what we have worked out in terms of presented behavior .	he's having a problem here .
easy Boyd .	no easy Boyd ! I got a best friend in there in pieces . how about a little sensitivity ?
he's cracked up .	he is not cracking up .
Boyd ... What have we done ?	what did you ask me ?
what is the question you asked me ?	I said , what have we done ?
yes , you did . now that is the question ! that is exactly the question we should be asking ourselves . you tell me Fisher . what have we done ?	I don't know ! I just want to get married .
say it again .	what ?
what you just said . say it again .	I just want to get married .
what's your point ?	you want to know what you are doing here ? ! you are love pumping . you are protecting all that is sacred and beautiful and in sync with poetry and sunsets and little newborn babies . you are walking the walk . this is it Fisher , the real stuff . you love this woman . love is second to nothing . I love you . I love Moore . I love Micheal . this car is full of love , and nothing - absolutely nothing - supersedes love , man . nothing . we will do what it takes . whatever it takes .
regarding what ?	does she sound pissed , scared , hostile ? did she mention the police ?
Jesus Boyd you're going to O.D. him .	suck my ass .
after you drop the kids off , take Micheal home . put a few drinks in him so he'll sleep .	I don't think that's such a good idea .
just do it .	what are you going to do ?
what does that mean ?	and what does that mean ? are you insane ? ! you think I would hurt Lois ? ! she's the mother of those kids ! what is wrong with you ?
I don't know ...	you got a nasty side to your thought process .
okay . here's the deal and it's a good one . Lois is cool . it's a pacified situation .	what does that mean ?
yeah .	good deal . Lois just wants to hear it from Micheal .
hear what ?	that it was all an accident . she wants to hear it from Micheal's mouth .
now ?	that's right .
isn't it a little late ?	hold on a sec . Lois , you sure you wouldn't rather do this in the morning ?
this is a situation that defies judgement . we have acted and showed courage that is not of a kind known by most .	I'm getting really tired of your bullshit .
my what ?	you've got a warped thought process . your brain doesn't function properly .
you care to add a little specification to that slanderous accusation ?	I'm talking about some bad , bad , very bad things . bad things ! those are bad fucking things !
okay fine .	fine ? fine what ?
whatever you say Kojak .	I'm serious .
blood money . insurance dollars that you have thus fucking far decided not to tell me about at all . in no way have you mentioned that money . and I find that to be very very offensive .	you're sick .
and if you think you can fuck me , don't . cause I'm fucking insulated Fisher . protected . backed up on floppy . do you get me ? I want my fucking money !	not a prayer .
I'm a lifesaver . a lighthouse . up all night in the rain , in stormy gale force wind , tornado and fucking earthquakes . I stay lit for you . I stay lit . I don't go dark . I never go dark !	you need help .
no I don't .	fish ?
your investment ideas never work out .	that's the whole point . they rarely work out . but on occasion they do . and when they do , they do big .
I don't think so Boyd .	fine . don't come crying to Boyd . no sir .
but not tonight .	not tonight .
Keith Richards , Dean Martin ...	Jack Kerouback , Herman Melville , Henry Miller and Hunter S. Thompson . I dedicate this evening to fear and to major loathing . so from sun set to sun rise , let me be heard ...
he's right .	we can take her out to Red Rock . find some quiet place ... and put her in the ground .
I got her arm .	here's his head .
the past is the past . today is the beginning of the rest of our lives .	today is the best day of the rest of our lives .
what's goosed ?	what is her disposition ?
he just had two .	give me two more .
he's too drunk .	he's fine . okay Mikey , let's go . you guys stay here .
what is it ?	ah , yeah , hi . is Tina there ?
what ?	I'm with Tina . is she there ?
she's not here .	where is she ?
who ?	the groom ?
Yup .	doing the bachelor party thing ?
that's right .	sin City . devil's playground . the Black Bitch . all day every day . where's Tina ?
she's in the bathroom ... she's still working .	she's still working ?
that's right .	sweet deal .
is everything okay ?	great . fine . perfect .
she's in there !	I'm just gonna let her know I'm here .
don't sweet lip me .	I don't understand where this personal attack is coming from ...
you're a liar . I want to know what happened in Vegas .	nothing happened in Vegas .
Micheal ? do you have something to tell me ?	Micheal . tell Lois that nothing ...
he's upset about Adam . we're all upset .	I will call the police right now if I don't start getting some answers .
my god .	there's more .
yes money . Adam had a five hundred dollar term Life Insurance Policy .	what does that mean ?
actually , no . Adam was switching to a Whole Life Policy , but re-scheduled his medical exam ... and failed to make his last payment ... so his term Life lapsed . so it's value is Null and void . now he did have a pension account , worth another 150 thousand .	well , oh ...
and a house . valued at 350 thousand .	so where's that leave us ?
so . when is the wedding .	tomorrow . we are getting married tomorrow .
we'll be ready Adam .	I know you'll be . three hours .
that's one idea .	no ... we want padded chairs ... okay ?
real times .	they've all been real times . and as you prepare to enter into a new phase of life , as you prepare for new roles ; father , husband , teacher , you will , as I have , come to except the letting go of of old ways . soon , the mellowing will begin ...
no . no . no . it's what my father said to me . he said it and he meant it ... He said to me ... He said , Adam , he said ... He told me and I heard him ... he said ... Hell he said so many Goddamn things I can't remember everything he said for Christsake .	right ! that's exactly what I'm saying . my father said , first of all , I'm your father not your friend . I'm your father .
are you solid with that ?	no . I think it's fucked .
the bucks gonna stop right here . if my son doesn't know the six New England states , if he has trouble with geography , I won't stick it in his face . I'll help the little guy . I'll put him in the car and take him out there . I'll take him to Maine for a big Lobster dinner , go skiing in Vermont , hot dogs at Yankee Stadium ... I won't stare him down .	don't ever stare him down .
I won't do it .	don't eyeball your kids .
I tell mine that they're little men . I tell them they're strong . they make me feel joy . I let' em know . so they really know that I need them just as much . you know . just as much man . and you know , you're their godfather ...	I know and I'm honored ...
if anything ever happens to me ...	I know ...
either side you idiot . I'm calling 911 .	what happened ? oh my God ...
no way .	it has to be done .
I want you to hear me out .	what .
you and I have done nothing . you especially . we are innocent .	I don't think so .
Jesus Adam , can we not get into this now please ?	I got a migraine like a little monkey kicking in the side of my skull , Mike Tyson with a fucking sledge hammer trying to crack ...
I got you .	where's the bathroom ?
don't snap at them !	they're driving me nuts !
what ?	they're screaming for Starbursts .
later .	they're screaming like monsters and it's giving me a headache . go get some fucking Starbursts .
where's the candy ?	there is no candy !
what do you mean ? it's it's a Goddamn mini-mart ? !	four hours and fifteen minutes . I can make Vegas in 3 and change .
don't even start .	you want to hear me out ?
one idea that if you had fucking listened to , you would each be worth approximately 15 million dollars .	you can't keep bringing up Starbucks . that was your only real hit in like 75 tries .
more .	over eight years of some of the hardest raging experiences of my life .
she's got no fucking pulse .	you don't know what you're doing .
wait !	what ?
what are you doing ?	what are you talking about ?
I'm calling the ambulance .	just wait a second . wait one second . okay . what are you doing ?
calling the ambulance .	why ? why ? she's dead . why are you calling an ambulance ?
we have to call the ambulance .	why ?
stop it ! listen to me . let's just take a second here and take hold of the situation , OK ? let's just review our options here .	we have a dead woman bleeding all over the bathroom . what options ? call the police .
call the police . okay , that's one option .	"that is not an "" option . "" there is no multiple choice here ."
stop it !	there's more .
just stop .	just giving the facts .
I'm calling the police .	what were we doing officer ? why didn't we help her ? well ... we're all a bit high , you know , bachelor party , that kind of thing . Fisher here is getting married in three days ... Beautiful wife ... he didn't have anything at all to do with it ... It was all Micheal here ... just Micheal ...
bury her out in the desert .	sure , why not .
you don't just casually walk out of a Vegas Casino with a dead woman .	we can do this . we can get her out of here .
have you completely lost your mind ? so you get her out of here . so you get her out into the desert somehow , without anybody seeing , so what , you don't think at some point somebody might notice that she's gone ?	nobody knows she's here . I called her personally . nobody knows .
her blood is all over the bathroom . I'd say that's a bit of a DNA problem .	it's a marble floor , we can clean it up .
her fucking head was caved in .	so I didn't fucking do it !
wrap her up in blankets . bring the car around to the back of the hotel , throw her off the balcony , put her in the car ... Done .	you don't think someone will have a problem with a body being thrown off a balcony ?
we check out the area and wait for a time when it's clear .	what about the blood ?
someone goes to WalMart , gets some buckets , brushes , mops , spic and span , the works .	have you ever done this before ?
sun rises at 5 : 52 .	I'm not wrecking the transmission !
wait . wait a minute .	what ?
we can't do this .	we've already done this .
how do you figure ?	according to Jewish law , the blood and limbs are considered to be part of the human being . they must be buried together or their souls won't rest in peace .
so that's what we're doing .	no we're not . the bodies are all mixed up . we can't do this to them .
she's Asian . they don't have Jews in Asia .	that is absolutely not true .
well what the fuck are we supposed to do ?	open the suitcases , unpack the body parts and reunite the limbs .
we have to get going .	I am not flexible on this .
now I am the last to say that we have done here is a good thing . it's not . it's not a good thing . but it was , given the circumstances , the smart play . we did what had to be done . and ... well ... I'm proud of us . I'm proud of each and every one of us . we performed . under the most complex and nerve shattering of situations , we stood fast and we delivered . I feel proud .	we are all going straight to hell . either hell or prison , whichever comes first .
Boyd you idiot , the shit's coming down !	what does that mean ?
you got us into this mess .	oh I did ? I think it was your little rat fuck brother who decided to play Hamburger helper with the hooker's head .
would you , shush ? ! these phones aren't secure !	lighten up Adam . show some character .
watch the tone fella .	fuck you Boyd !
what is your problem ?	I can't do this .
what ?	at the seven-eleven .
who ? what are you talking about ?	they're on me . they're smoking me out !
you got some mighty fucking fine bad timing Adam . we got a rehearsal situation here .	I don't give a damn .
I didn't do anything ! I'll turn your pathetic ass in !	Adam ! calm down .
I won't calm down . I can't do this . we can't do this . it won't work . it will not work .	it has worked .
I'm talking about DNA samples , fiber optics , search parties , they got infrared scanners , FBI scientists . they figure this shit out . they always figure it out .	they won't figure it out .
all right . let's all go back in . Adam ? you're cool right ?	no . I'm not Boyd . I am not cool at all .
we're leaving from my house in three hours . if you want to come , get your numbers in order by then .	first of all ...
no first of all . I'm not in a game mood .	you're interrupting a personal conversation .
because my opinion threatens yours , it's poorly developed ?	no , because your opinions are idiotic and have nothing to do with what any given conversation is about , which makes 85 % of your eagerly injected thought process highly offensive to me .
you're an asshole Adam .	you're an asshole .
oh , and why am I an asshole ?	multiple reasons .
name one .	I don't have to ...
tonight we return once again to the cave . tonight we let the monsters out . we fill ourselves with the spirits of Genghis Khan , Joe Namath , JFK , Paton , Lombardi , Hemingway ...	Franco mother-fucking Harris !
I was just playing ... we were playing just playing around .	she's dead .
we were playing ... she slipped ... she hit her head .	playing ?
the floor was wet . she slipped !	why was the floor wet ?
I don't know why the floor was wet !	why ? !
why ?	it's sacrilegious .
this is pathetic .	you're pathetic .
what did you say ?	you're not a team player .
don't point at me .	you never were a team player . that's why you never had any friends .
I have plenty of friends .	the hell you do .
the hell I don't .	you have acquaintances - business friends and superficial golf buddies . you have always been a fringe player . you have some serious male on male intimacy problems .
about anybody but yourself . you never have .	and you're a little fucking reject .
if you ever touch my minivan again , I'll make you sorry . real sorry .	you're a loser .
you got a retarded kid and a fat pig wife .	you fucking bastard !
don't you threaten me you little rat fuck .	don't you fucking threaten me - I'll fucking kill you .
go home !	you go home !
how ya doing ?	what ?
what's that ?	what did you say ?
I said how's it going ?	I didn't hear you .
well that's what I said .	the stripper's here .
she's fucking hot !	I need a drink .
Jesus .	don't touch her . call 911 .
they'll get us on accesory to murder .	bullshit it's not accesory . I didn't do shit . you call the cops , you explain it was an accident ...
I'm not going to ruin my life over a dead whore .	"that's a horrible ugly comment . "" dead whore ? "" she's a person !"
can't do what ?	we're gonna get caught . I know we're gonna get caught . they were eyeballing my car .
but you said grey , sir .	not tweed -- it's a smoother material , with a larger collar and belted .
she'll be out in a moment .	now , Judy , it isn't anything to get --
yes ! that's it !	I thought so !
oh , yes ! it may need some slight alterations , but it is madam's size . all right , dear . we'll have it for you to try in a moment .	how soon can it be altered ?
well ...	can we have it by tonight ?
well , if it's absolutely necessary ...	yes , it is . now , I want to look at an evening dress , a dinner dress , black -- short -- long sleeves -- with a neck cut this ... ... and the skirt out .
yes ... the Beautiful Carlotta ... the Sad Carlotta ...	what does a big old wooden house on the corner of Eddy and Gough Street have to do with her ?
it was hers . it was built for her . many years ago .	by whom ?
she died .	how ?
by her own hand . there are many such stories .	thank you , Mr. Leibel . thank you very much .
OW ! !	I thought you said no more aches and pains ?
it's this darned corset . it binds . he retrieves the stick .	no three-way stretch ? how very un- chic .
well , you know those police department doctors : no sense of style . ah , tomorrow !	what's tomorrow ?
more than you think .	how do you know ? personal experience ?
please ! and what happens after tomorrow ?	what do you mean ?
what are you going to do ? now that you've quit the police force ?	you sound so disapproving , Midge .
no , it's your life . but you were the bright young lawyer who decided he was going to be chief of police some day .	I had to quit , Midge .
why ?	I wake up at night seeing him fall from the roof ... and try to reach out for him .
it wasn't your fault .	I know . everybody tells me .
Johnny , the doctors explained --	I know . I have Acrophobia . what a disease . a fear of heights . and what a moment to find out I had it .
well , you've got it . and there's no losing it . and there's no one to blame . so why quit ?	and sit behind a desk ? Chairborne ?
it's where you belong .	not with my Acrophobia , Midge . if I dropped a pencil on the floor and bent down to pick it up , it could be disastrous !
nothing for a while . you forget , I'm a man of independent means . or fairly independent .	mmm . why don't you go away for a while ?
to forget ? don't be so motherly , Midge . I'm not going to crack up .	have you had any dizzy spells this week ?
it's a brassiere . you know about those things . you're a big boy , now .	I've never run across one like that .
it's brand new . revolutionary uplift . no shoulder straps , no back straps , but does everything a brassiere should do . it works on the principle of the cantilever bridge .	Uh-huh !
an aircraft engineer down the peninsula designed it . he worked it out in his spare time .	what a pleasant hobby .
how's your love life , Midge ?	that's following a train of thought .
well ?	normal .
aren't you ever going to get married ?	you know there's only one man in the world for me , Johnny-O .
yeah , I'm a brute . we were engaged once though , weren't we ?	three whole weeks .
ah , sweet college days . but you're the one who blew it . I'm still available . available Ferguson . say , Midge , do you remember a guy at college named Gavin Elster ?	Gavin ? Gavin Elster ? you'd think I'd would . no .
I got a call from him today . funny . he dropped out of sight during the war , and I'd heard he'd gone East . I guess he's back . it's a Mission number .	that's Skid Row ... isn't it ?
could be .	he's probably on the bum and wants to touch you for the price of a drink .
well , I'm on the bum ; I'll buy him a couple of drinks and tell him my troubles . but not tonight . if you won't drink with me , I'll drink alone , tonight .	sorry , old man . work .
Midge , what did you mean , there's no losing it ?	what .
my ... the acrophobia .	I asked my doctor . he said only another emotional shock could do it , and probably wouldn't . and you're not going to go diving off another rooftop to find out .
I think I can lick it .	how ?
that ! ? !	what do you want me to start with -- the Golden Gate Bridge ?
now . I look up , I look down . I look up , I look down . nothing to it .	stop kidding . wait a minute .
step number two .	okay .
easy , now .	this is a cinch . I look up , I look down . I look up --
Johnny !	oh , damn it ! damn it , damn it --
"now , that's the kind of greeting a girl likes . none of this "" hello you look wonderful "" stuff . just a good straight "" who do you know "" --"	well , who ? come on , you know everybody .
not that kind of history . the small stuff ! about people you never heard of !	oh ! you mean Gay Old Bohemian Days of Gay Old San Francisco ! the juicy stories ? like who shot who in the Embarcadero August , 1879 ?
yeah .	pop Leibel .
who ?	pop Leibel owns the Argosy Book Shop . what do you want to know ?
who shot who in the Embarcadero in August , 1879 .	wait a minute ! you're not a detective any more . what's going on ?
do you know him well ?	pop Leibel ? sure .
now then , Johnny-O ; pay me .	for what ?
for bringing you here . come on , tell !	nothing to tell .
you'll tell , or you'll be back in that corset ! come on !	I'll take you home .
here you are .	you haven't told me everything .
I've told you enough .	who's the guy , who's the wife ?
out . I've got things to do .	I know . the one who phoned . your old college chum , Elster .
and the idea is that the Beautiful Mad Carlotta has come back from the dead , to take possession of Elster's wife ? ah , Johnny ! come on !	I'm not telling you what I think ! I'm telling you what he thinks !
Carlotta ?	no , not Carlotta . Elster's wife .
Midge !	bye-bye !
I did . since when do you go about slipping notes under men's doors ?	since I stopped being able to get them on the phone . for a man who has nothing to do , you're certainly a busy little bee . where do you go , these days ?
just wander .	where ?
around .	oh ?
Mm . better .	did you need it ?
yeah .	oh ?
what was this desperate urge to see me ?	"all I said in the note was : "" where are you ? "" that doesn't sound desperate to me ."
well , I detected an undercurrent .	I just thought if I gave you a drink and fed you some dinner , you'd be so grateful you'd take me to a movie .
fair enough . what'll we talk about at dinner ?	oh ... this and that .
what I've been doing ?	if you want to . naturally , we won't talk about anything you don't want to talk about .
naturally .	what have you been doing ?
oh , I'm having a wonderful time ! I've gone back to my first love ... painting .	good . I've always said you were wasting your time in the underwear department .
well , it's a living . but I'm excited about this .	what is it , a still life ?
is there something I can do for you ?	yes ... you run this hotel .
oh , yes !	would you tell me , who has the room on the second floor in the corner , that corner ?
please answer my question .	I can't imagine that sweet girl with that dear face --
what is her name ?	Valdes . Miss Valdes . it's Spanish , you know .
Carlotta Valdes ?	yes , that's it . sweet name , isn't it ? foreign . but sweet .
how long has she had the room ?	oh , it must be two weeks . yes , the rent's due tomorrow .
does she sleep here ? ever ?	no ... she only comes to sit . two or three times a week . and I never ask questions , you know . as long as they're well behaved . I must say that I've wondered --
when she comes down , don't say that I've been here .	oh , but she hasn't been here today . Scottie whirls back on her .
I saw her come in five minutes. ago .	oh , no ! she hasn't been here at all ! I would have seen her , you know . I've been right here all the time , putting olive oil on my rubber plant leaves !
and there ! there you see ? her key is on the rack !	would you please go and look ?
her car is gone .	what car ?
why am I here ? what happened ?	you ... ... fell into the Bay .
you don't remember .	no ...
do you remember where you were ?	oh , of course I remember that ! but then I must have had a dizzy spell , and fainted !
where were you ?	at ...
... Old Port Point ! out at the Presidio ! of course I remember ! I often go there !	why ?
because I love it so . it's beautiful there . especially at sunset . ah ... thank you for the fire .	where had you been before ?
when ?	this afternoon .
oh ... wandering about .	before ? where ? where had you been ?
please drink your coffee .	I will . you're terribly direct in your questions .
I'm sorry . I didn't mean to be rude .	you're not . merely direct . what were you doing there ? at Old Fort Point ?
wandering about .	you like it , too .
the Palace of the Legion of honor . the Art Gallery .	oh , that's a lovely spot , isn't it ? I've never been inside . but it looks so lovely , driving past .
lucky for me you were wandering about . thank you again . I've been terrible bother to you .	no .
when you ... There were pins in my hair ...	oh ! yes ! here !
you shouldn't have brought me here , you know .	I ... didn't know where you lived .
you could have looked in my car . oh , but you didn't know my car , did you ?	yes , I knew which one it was . it's out there , now . but I didn't think you'd want to be brought home that way .
my name is John Ferguson .	that's a good , strong name . do your friends call you John ? or Jack .
John . old friends . acquaintances call me Scottie .	I shall call you Mr. Ferguson .
no , I wouldn't like that . and after what happened today I should think you could call me Scottie . or even John .	I prefer John . there , that's done . and what do you do , John ?
wander about .	that's a good occupation . and live here ... alone ?
one shouldn't live alone .	some people prefer it .
will you tell me something ? has this ever happened to you before ?	what ?
... falling ... into San Francisco Bay ?	no , never before . I've fallen into lakes , out of rowboats , when I was a little girl . and I fell into a river , once , trying to leap from one stone to another . but I've never fallen into San Francisco Bay . have you ? ever before ?
oh ! yes . hello .	good morning . I worried about you , last night . you shouldn't have run like that .
I ... suddenly felt such a fool .	I wanted to drive you home . are you all right ?
oh , yes . fine . no after effects . but as I remember now , that water was cold , wasn't it ? what a terrible thing to do ... and you were so kind ... It's a formal thank-you letter . and a great big apology .	you've nothing to apologize for .
oh , yes ! the whole thing must have been so embarrassing for you !	not at all , I enjoyed --
-- talking to you ...	I enjoyed talking to you .
would you like some coffee ?	no ! no , thank you !
I couldn't mail it ; I didn't know your address . but I had a landmark . I remembered Coit Tower and it led me straight to you .	the first time I've been grateful for Coit Tower .
I hope we will , too .	what ?
meet again , sometime .	we have .
I don't know .	shopping ?
no .	well ... anywhere in particular ?
no , I Just thought I'd wander .	ah . that's what I was going to do .
oh , yes , I forgot : it's your occupation , isn't it ?	don't you think it's sort of a waste for the two of us to ...
wander separately ? ah , but only one is a Wanderer . two , together , are always going somewhere .	no ... no , I don't think that's necessarily true .
do you know where you're going ?	of course not ! I'm a Wanderer ! I'd like to go somewhere I've never been !
how can you be sure ?	if I've been there ? that's silly ! either you've been to a place or you haven't .
how old ?	oh ... some , two thousand years , or more .
what are you thinking ?	of all the people who have been born ... and have died ... while the trees went on living .
their true name is Sequoia Sempervirens : always green , ever- living .	I don't like them .
why ?	knowing I have to die ...
do you hear anything ?	only silence . it's always like this .
and no birds sing .	no birds live here .
no .	would you like a drink of water ?
where are you now ?	here with you .
where ?	the tall trees ...
have you been here before ?	yes ...
long ago ...	where ?
no ! ... No !	tell me what it is . where do you go ? what takes you away ?
no , don't ask me !	when you jumped in the bay , you didn't know where you were . you guessed but you didn't know .
I didn't jump , I fell ! you told me I fell !	why did you jump ?
what was it inside that told you to jump ?	no , I can't tell you !
what ? !	no ! please ! please , please , please , please , don't ask me !
take me away from here ?	home ?
but the small scenes , the fragments in the mirror : you remember them .	vaguely ...
what do you remember ?	a room ... there is a room , and I sit there alone ... always alone ...
no ... it's in shadow .	what else ?
a grave ...	where ?
I don't know . an open grave . I stand by the gravestone looking down into it . and it's my grave .	how do you know ?
I know .	there's a name on the gravestone .
no . it's new and clean , and waiting .	what else ?
this part is dream , I think . there is a tower and a bell and ... a garden below ... but it seems to be in Spain ... a village in Spain . and then it clicks off , and is gone .	a portrait ? do you ever see a portrait ?
no .	of the woman in the mirror . would you know her if you saw her ?
but I'm the woman in the mirror !	no !
if I could find the key ... find the beginning put it together ...	and so explain it away ? but there is a way to explain it , you see . if I'm mad ? that would explain it , wouldn't it ?
I'm here , I've got you ...	I'm so afraid ... ... you won't let it happen ...
don't leave me ... stay with me ...	all the time .
I should have phoned ... but I wanted to see you ... be with you ...	why ? what's happened ?
no , don't go away !	only this far .
where's your husband ?	I didn't wake him . I don't want him to know ...
it was a dream , you're awake , you're all right , now . can you tell me ?	it was the tower again ... and the bell , and the old Spanish village ...
yes --	but clear ... so very clear ... for the first time ... all of it ...
tell me .	there was a village square , a green with trees ... and an old whitewashed Spanish church with a cloister . across the green : a big , grey , wooden house with a porch and shutters and a balcony above ... a small garden , and next to it , a livery stable ... with old carriages lined up inside .
go on .	at the end of the green there was a whitewashed stone house with a lovely pepper tree at the corner --
-- and an old wooden hotel of the old California days , and a saloon ... dark ... low-ceilinged ... with hanging oil lamps .	yes ? ! but --
no , never !	Madeleine , a hundred miles south of San Francisco there's an old Spanish Mission , Mission San Juan Bautista . it's been preserved exactly as it was a hundred years ago as a museum . now , think hard , darling . you've been there before . you've seen it !
go on with your dream . what was it that frightened you ?	I stood alone on the green , searching for something , and I started to walk to the church . but then the darkness closed in , I was alone in the dark , being pulled into darkness , and I fought to wake up ...
here with you .	and it's a all real .
yes .	not merely as it was a hundred years ago . as it was a year ago , or six months ago , whenever you were here to see it . Madeleine , think of when you were here !
my love ... because I love you .	I love you too ... too late ... too late ...
no ... we're together ...	too late ... there's something I must do ...
there are things I have to tell you , about how we met , and why we are together . but they can wait . the only important thing now is that I love you and I'm going to keep you safe .	you can't .
why ?	let me go .
where ?	to the church , I must go there .
Madeleine --	please let me go .
it's not fair , it's too late . it wasn't supposed to happen this way , it shouldn't have happened ... !	it had to . we're in love . that's all that counts . Madeleine --
let me go ! let me go ! !	Madeleine ! !
yes .	and if you lose me , you'll know that I loved you and wanted to go on loving you .
I won't lose you .	let me go into the church alone .
why ?	please . because I love you . he stares at her , sees the pleading look in her eyes , and lets go . she turns and walks away toward the church , slowly , her head bowed . he watches her go and starts to move after her . then slowly , as she goes , her head begins to go up until finally , as she walks , she is staring high above her . and then , suddenly , she breaks into a broken run .
could I ask you a couple of questions ?	what for ? who are you ?
is this some kind of Gallup Poll , or something ?	no , there are just a few things I want to ask you , and --
do you live here in the hotel ?	no , I happened to see you come in , and I thought --
0h , I thought so ! a pick-up ! well , you've got a nerve , following me right into the hotel and up to my room ! you beat it ! go on ! beat it !	no , please ! I Just want to talk to you !
listen , I'm going to yell in a minute !	I'm not going to hurt you ! I promise ! please !
just let me talk to you .	what about ?
you .	why ?
I've heard that one before , too . I remind you of someone you used to be madly in love with , but she ditched you for another guy , and you've been carrying the torch ever since , and then you saw me and something clicked . huh !	you're not far wrong .
well , it's not going to work . so you'd better go .	let me come in .
I warn you , I can yell awfully loud .	you won't have to .
your name . and --	Judy Barton .
who you are --	just a girl , I work at Magnin's --
-- and how you happen to be living here .	it's a place to live , that's all .
but you haven't lived here long .	about three years .
no , a year ago ! where did you live a year ago ! ! ?	I told you ! right here !
but before ! where did you live before ! ? !	Salina , Kansas !
listen , what is this ? what do you want ?	I want to know who you are .
will you have dinner with me ?	why ?
well , I feel I owe you something for all this ...	no , you don't owe me anything .
then will you for me ?	dinner ... and what else ?
just dinner .	because I remind you of her ?
because I'd like to have dinner with you .	well ... I've been on blind dates before ... matter of fact , to be honest , I've been picked up before . okay .
I'll get my car and be back in half an hour .	oh , no ! give me time to change and get fixed up !
an hour ?	mmm .
thank you again . good-night .	can I see you tomorrow ?
tomorrow night ? well --	tomorrow morning .
tomorrow m -- but I have to go to work . I've got a job .	don't go .
and what will I live on ? my oil wells in Texas ?	I'll take care of you .
no , Judy , you don't understand .	oh , I understand , all right . I've been understanding since I was seventeen . and the next step is , as long as you're going to see me tomorrow , why don't you stay the night .
no .	no ? then what ?
I just want to see you as much as I can !	"as friends ? we'd just see a lot of each other as friends , and you'd "" take care of me "" ?"
yes .	why ? because I remind you of someone ? that's not very complimentary . and nothing would ... happen ...
no .	that's not very complimentary , either .
no , Judy , I'm not going to move ! please ! stay in the chair !	why ? !
I like that one .	no , there . there's a good one . do you like that ?
okay . now we're going to buy you some clothes .	honest ?
there's Ransohoff's . nothing but the best . come on .	but Scottie , you don't have to !
but I like that one , Scottie .	no , it's not right .
Scottie , what are you doing ?	I'm trying to buy you a suit .
but I loved the second one she wore . and this one -- -- is beautiful .	they're none of them right .
you want me to dress like her ?	Judy , I just want you to look nice . and I know what kind of suit would look well on you .
ah , no ! ! ! I don't want to be dressed like someone dead !	Judy --
Judy , it can't make much difference to you . I just want to see how you'd look and I know it won't be the same , but --	no , I don't want any clothes ! I don't want anything ! I want to get out of here !
I don't like it !	we'll take it ! will it fit ?
I wish you'd leave me alone . I want to go away .	you can .
no , you wouldn't let me . and I don't want to go ...	Judy , I want to tell you : these few days have been the first happy days I've had in a year .
I know . because I remind you of her . the one that's dead . and not even that , very much .	no , it's you too , Judy . something in you .
the color of your hair ...	ah , no !
Judy , please it can't matter to you ...	the trouble is , I'm gone now . for you . and I can't do anything about it . I want you to love me . if I let you change me , will that do it ? if I do what you tell me , will you love me ?
yes .	all right . then I'll do it . because I don't care about me anymore . I just want you to love me .
well ?	it should be back from your face -- with a bun at the neck . I told them . I told you .
where shall we go for dinner ?	wherever you'd like ...
Ernie's ?	you've got a thing about Ernie's , haven't you ?
Mmmm .	is that the best you can do ?
oh , no . you'll muss me .	that's what I had in mind .
no , Ernie's is fine .	I'm going to have one of those big beautiful steaks . and ... let's see ... to start ...
I've got it . he bends down and bites the back of her neck .	oh ! you're supposed to fasten it !
Scottie !	how does it work ?
can't you see ?	oh , yeah . there .
I feel like driving . are you terrible hungry ?	no , it's all right .
where are you going ?	to complete my cure .
Scottie , why are we here ?	I told you . I have to go back into the past . once more . for the last time .
but why ? why here ?	Madeleine died here .
I need you .	why ?
I can't do it alone . I need you , to be Madeleine for a while . then , when it's done , we'll both be free .	I'm scared .
"... We stood there and I kissed her for the last time . and she said , "" If lose me , you'll know that I loved you --"	Scottie --
and I couldn't follow her . God knows I tried . one doesn't often get a second chance . I want to stop being haunted . you're my second chances , Judy .	take me away ...
you look like Madeleine , now . go up the stairs .	no !
we're going up the tower , Madeleine .	no ! let me go !
we're going up the tower .	you can't . you're afraid !
I'm going to . it's my second chance .	Scottie , please ... !
but you knew , that day , that I wouldn't be able to follow you didn't you . who was at the top when you got there ? Elster ? with his wife ?	yes !
and she was the one who died . not you . the real wife . you were the copy , you were the counterfeit . was she dead or alive when you got there ?	dead . he'd broken her neck .
took no chances , did he ? and when you got there , he pushed her off the tower , was that it ? but you were the one who screamed . why did you scream ?	I wanted to stop it , I ran up to stop it --
yes !	and you were such an apt pupil ! what fun you two must have had , playing games with me ! why me ? why did he pick on me ? ! !
your accident ...	ah , yes ! I was a set-up . I was the made-to-order witness . where is he now ?
I don't know ... Switzerland ?	we'll find him .
I made it .	what are you going to do ?
oh , Judy ! ! when he had all her money , and the freedom and the power ... he ditched you ? what a shame ! but he knew he was safe . you couldn't talk . didn't he give you anything ?	some money .
and the necklace . Carlotta's necklace . that was your mistake , Judy . one shouldn't keep souvenirs of a killing . you shouldn't have been that sentimental .	what are you going to do ?
I loved you , Madeleine .	I was safe when you found me , there was nothing you could prove ! but when I saw you again I couldn't run away , I loved you so ! I walked into danger and let you change me again because I loved you and wanted you ! Scottie , please ! you love me now ! love me ! keep me safe !
love me ... keep me safe ...	too late ... too late ... there's no bringing her back .
hello .	Scottie , what happened ? she's not home , yet .
no , she's all right . she's still here . but I'll get her home soon .	what happened ?
did she hurt herself ?	no . she's in fine shape . nothing to worry about . but she doesn't know . you understand that . she doesn't know what she did .
how'd you get into the shipbuilding business , Gavin ?	I married into it .
interesting business .	no , to be honest , I find it dull .
you don't have to do it for a living .	no . but one assumes obligations . my wife's family is all gone ; someone has to look after her interest . her father's partner runs the company yard in the East -- Baltimore -- so I decided as long as I had to work at it , I'd come back here . I've always liked it here .
how long have you been back ?	almost a year .
and you like it .	San Francisco's changed . the things a that spell San Francisco to me are disappearing fast .
like all this .	I'd like to have lived here then . the color and excitement ... the power ... the freedom .
shouldn't you be sitting down ?	no , I'm all right .
I was sorry to read about that thing in the papers . and you've quit the force . a permanent physical disability ?	no , Acrophobia isn't a crippling thing . it just means I can't climb steep stairs or go to high places , like the bar at the Top-of-the-Mark . but -- -- there are plenty of street-level bars In this town .
would you like a drink now ?	"no ... no , thanks . a bit early in the day for spirits . well , I guess that about covers everything , doesn't it ? I never married ; I don't see much of the "" old college gang "" ; I'm a retired detective -- and you're in the shipbuilding business . what's on your mind , Gavin ?"
not what you think . we're very happily married .	then ?
I'm afraid some harm may come to her .	from whom ?
no .	if I told you I believe that his happened to my wife , what would you say ?
I'd say you'd better take her to the nearest psychiatrist , psychologist , neurologist , psychoanalyst , or plain family doctor . and have him check you both .	then you're of no use to me . I'm sorry I wasted your time . thank you for coming in , Scottie .
I didn't mean to be that rough .	no , it sounds idiotic , I know . and you're still the hard-headed Scot , aren't you ? always were . do you think I'm making it up ?
no .	I'm not making it up . I wouldn't know how . she'll be talking to me about something , nothing at all , and suddenly the words fade into silence and a cloud comes into her eyes and they go blank ... and she is somewhere else , away from me ... someone I don't know . I call to her and she doesn't hear . and then with a long sigh she is back , and looks at me brightly , and doesn't know she's been away ... can't tell me where ... or why ...
how often does this happen ?	more and more in the past few weeks . and she wanders . God knows where she wanders . I followed her one day .
where'd she go ?	watched her come out of the apartment , someone I didn't know ... walking in a different way ... holding her head in a way I didn't know ; and get into her car , and drive out to ... Golden Gate Park . five miles . she sat on a bench at the edge of the lake and stared across the water to the old pillars that stand an the far shore , the Portals of the past . sat there a long time , not moving ... and I had to leave , to got to the office . that evening , when I came home , I asked what she'd done all day . she said she'd driven to Golden Gate Park and sat by the lake . that's all .
well ?	the speedometer of her car showed she had driven 94 miles that day . where did she go ? I have to know , Scottie . where she goes and what she does , before I got involved with doctors .
have you talked to the doctors at all ?	yes , but carefully . I'd want to know more before committing her to that kind of care . Scottie --
I can get you a firm of private eyes to follow her for you . they're dependable , good boys --	I want you .
it's not my line .	Scottie , I need a friend ! someone I can trust ! I'm in a panic about this !
how can I see her , to know her ?	we're going to an opening at the opera tonight . we'll dine at Ernie's first . which is easier ?
Ernie's .	all right . you won't know what to look for at first , Scottie . even I , who know her so well , cannot tell , sometimes , when the change has begun . she looks so lovely and normal ...
you've done well , Scottie . you're good at your job .	that's Carlotta Valdes .
yes .	there are things you didn't tell me .
I didn't know where she was going to lead you .	but you knew about this .
Carlotta Valdes was what : your wife's grandmother ?	Great-grandmother . the child who was taken from her whose loss drove Carlotta mad and to her death - was Madeleine's grandmother .
well , that explains it . anyone could develop an obsession for the past , with a background like that .	but she doesn't know , about her background . she never heard of Carlotta Valdes .
knows nothing of a grave out at Mission Dolores , or an old house an Eddy Street , or a portrait at the Palace of the Legion of Honor ?	nothing .
and when she goes to those places ...	she is not my wife .
how do you know all these things she doesn't know ?	her mother told me most of then before she died . I dug out the rest for myself , here .
why did she never tell her daughter ?	natural fear . her grandmother went insane and took her own life . and the blood is in Madeleine . Scottie , I ask you to watch her closely .
he had no right to say that . it was my responsibility . you didn't know her . I shouldn't have got you involved .	I -- I --
doctor , how long is it going to take you to pull him out of this ?	it is hard to say . six months , at least . perhaps a year . it depends to a certain extent on him .
he won't talk .	no . we have ways of digging out knowledge . but it takes longer . he is suffering from acute melancholia , together with a guilt complex . he blames himself for what happened to the woman . and we know little of the background .
I can give you one thing : he was in love with her .	ah ? that complicates the problem .
Franky can't make it . he had an appointment he forgot , he's going to see you later . I'm Mickey Morrissey , we're supposed to get to know each other .	how'm I doing so far ?
Stearns , Harrington , you know who that is ?	should I ?
a huge law firm . okay ? they put him in the firm , he's married , everything's superb . Franky , he's starting to talk like he comes from Dorsetshire , some fuckin' place ,' You must drop by with Pat and me ...' Okay ... ?	yes .
... and he's making a billion dollars every minute working for Stearns , Harrington , and he bought a dog , and everything is rosy . then Mr. Stearns , he tried to fix a case .	the Big Boy did ... ?
huh .	before he can get there here comes this Federal Marshal , and Franky's indicted for Jury tampering , they throw him in jail , he's gonna be disbarred , his life is over . Jimmy , gimme another drink . how are you ?
me , too .	okay . now , so he's in jail . he , finally , he gets to see the light , he calls up Harrington , he says he thinks he made a mistake . as if by magic , charges against him are dropped , he's released from jail . P.S. He's fired from the firm , his wife divorces him , he turns to drink and mopes around three and a half years . you like that story ?
Dr. Towler ...	yes .
you have a record of what happened in the operating room ...	yes , that's correct .
... there are notations every thirty seconds ...	yes .
... of the procedures ...	yes , the roving nurse ...
we , we were rather busy ...	Four-and-one-half minutes after her heart stopped . and they resume seven minutes ...
as I've said we had some more ...	... they start again three minutes earlier ...
we had rather more important things on our mind than taking notes . we were trying to restore her ...	what happened in those three ...
... we were trying to restore her heartbeat .	what happened in those three minutes ... ?
we'd gone to' Code Blue ,' we were administering electro ...	why did it take that long to get her heartbeat ...
brain damage could have been ... it didn't necessarily take nine minutes , it could have been caused in two ...	wait , wait , wait , you're saying that her brain damage could have been caused by her being deprived of oxygen for two minutes ... ?
yes .	huh . and why is that ?
because she was anemic . it's right there on her chart . her brain was getting less oxygen anyway ...	another , Frank . . . ?
I want to buy you a drink .	thanks , Franky .
well , well , well . huh ?	yeah .
it's a long road that has no turning .	that's for sure , Frank .
hi .	hi . how are you doing ?
you live in the neighborhood ?	Uh-huh . my nephew's going to be staying with us in a few months , so I stopped by .
how old is he ?	four . you're great with these kids .
thank you .	you're really ... You , are you the one they told me was the nurse ?
who told you that ?	Mrs ...
Mrs. Simmonds .	yes .
I used to be a nurse .	that's a wonderful profession . my daughter-in-law's a nurse . what did you do , stop ?
Kathy Price ...	yes ...
you were the Admitting Nurse at St. Catherine Laboure Hospital on May twelfth , nineteen seventy-six , the night Deborah Ann Kaye was admitted ...	yes .
yes .	these are your initials ,' K.C.' ?
Kathy Costello . that's my maiden name .	d'you ask the patient when did she last eat ?
yes .	what did she say ?
one hour .	yes .
and did you write the numeral' one' down on the record , standing for one hour ?	I did .
a single hour .	yes .
I spoke to her , and everything is all right .	I , what are you talking about ? I talked to her this morning , and she said ...
she told me .	she did ?
I just saw her .	in New York ?
what ?	you saw Kat in New York ... ... or is she in town ? is she in town ... ?
I'm ... Mrs. Doneghy ? I'm Frank Galvin ... why didn't you go in ?	it's locked .
it's not a good case . it's a very good case . a healthy young woman goes into the hospital to deliver her third child , she's given the wrong anaesthetic ...	... we , we love her , Dick and me ...
... I'm sure you do ...	but what can we do ? she don't know who's visiting her ...
... I know . I went ...	... You saw her ?
yes . yes , I have .	you know how beautiful she was ? her husband left her , and he took her kids .... They , they , they'd let you die in there . they don't care . nobody cares . the Patriot Home , the Chronic Care ... in Arlington ... ? they'd take her in . perpetual care . they'd take her . fifty thousand dollars they want . an endowment .
... fifty thousand dollars ?	I don't want to leave her . Dick ... the , the ... and Father Laughlin , he said that it was God's will ...
... I understand ...	my doctor told me that I got to move out West ... that's when we filed in court . we didn't want to sue ...
... I understand ...	... But Dick , he's looking for two years in Tucson ... and they called him up and said to come out . he's a good man . he's only trying to do what's right .
he saw her at the Northern Care ...	... and I have inquiries out to doctors , experts in the field ... there is , of course , a problem getting a doctor to testify that another doctor's negligent ...
we just can't do it anymore . this is our chance to get away .	I'm going to see you get that chance .
what does it mean ? I ... I mean we , you have other tactics ...	we , yes . yes . they , they present their side , and I get the same chance . to cross-examine ... to ... to ...
are we going to win ? we have , you know , other tactics , though ...	yes .
hi , Mickey ...	what the hell do you think you're doing ... ? what's going on here ... ?
uh ...	fuck you . I got a call today from Sally Doneghy ...
... now who is that ... ?	... You're' sposed to be in court in ten days and she's telling me you haven't even met with them ...

that's the point , you stupid fuck . let them buy it . we let them buy the case . that's what I took it for . you let this drop -- we'll go up to New Hampshire , kill some fuckin' deer ...	Mick . Mick . Mick ...
what ?	you -- Listen : you said to me ,' if not now , when ...'
I know what I said but not now . you won it . Franky . you won it . when they give you the money , that means that you won . we don't want to go to court -- is this getting to you ... ? you know who the attorney is for the Archdiocese , Eddie Concannon .	... he's a good man ...

Admittance form is wrong .	forget it . you can't prove it . sister's testimony is no good . jury knows we win she gets the cash .
I've got my Dr. Gruber , says her heart condition means they gave her the wrong anaesthetic anyway , plus she came in complaining of stomach pains ...	... Gruber's not bad.GALVIN Not bad ... ? this guy's Dr. Kildare , the jury's going to love him , Mick ... And you calm down , all right ? their guy , Towler's , the author of the book ,' Methodology and Practice , Anesthesiology .' ... and they got depositions from the nurses , everybody in the operating room , the scrub-nurse ...' All these guys are God . I saw them walk on water ...'

so what ... ? the best is yet to come . check the TV Guide . they got our Dr. Towler on a panel on GBH on Friday :' the Healing Hand . the Experts Speak .'	they still have to take it to a jury .
what I'm saying , they're getting some help .	so what do you want me to do ? Concannon's going to try the case his way , I'm going to try it mine . you want me to go wee wee wee all the time because he's got some flack , got stories in the newspaper . I'm going to win this case .

Rooney's protecting someone . who is she protecting ?	the Doctors .
she's protecting the Doctors she'd be up there on the stand ...	read me what she said .
... one of the other nurses ?	who ? they're all testifying . everybody who was in the O.R.' s going to take the stand .
all right . who wasn't in the O.R. ?	what difference can that make ... ? all right ...
uh ... the admitting nurse ...	what did she do ?
she didn't do anything . she took the patient's history and signed the charts .' K.C.'' Kathy Costello ...'	the' History' ... ?
we don't have anything from the Nurse Association ?	the broad has disappeared ...
... yeah ... good ...	... you need some old forms that she had ... somebody's dying ...
... four years ago ...	hello . this is Mr. Dorchester in Records . we're looking for Kathy Costello ...
what the hell are you doing here ?	we got to talk .
what are you doing in New York ... ?	come on , we'll get a cup of coffee ...

a brick house says you divorced him . I'll put you on your honor . bet you a hundred dollars against you join me for dinner . and I'll take your word for it . now you tell me the truth . because you cannot lie to me . what's your name ?	Laura .
my name's Frank . and furthermore , you came back to see me tonight .	what if it wasn't you that I came back to see ?
the weak , the weak have got to have somebody to fight for them . isn't that the truth ? you want another drink ?	I think I will .
Jimmy ! that's why the court exists . the court doesn't exist to give them justice , eh ? but to give them a chance at justice .	and are they going to get it ?
they might . yes . that's the point ... is that they might ... you see , the jury wants to believe . they're all cynics , sure , because they want to believe . I have to go in there tomorrow to find twelve people to hear this case . I'm going to see a hundred people and pick twelve . and every one of them it's written on their face ,' This is a sham . there is no justice ...' but in their heart they're saying ,' Maybe ... maybe ...'	maybe what ?
maybe I can do something right .	and is that what you're going to do ? is that what you're going to do ... ?
would you like me to leave ... ? is this a bad time -- ?	what ... ?

I've got to work .	you can't work if you can't think . you get in bed . it's all right . I'll stay here with you . it's all right . come on ...
you're going to stay here ... ?	yes .
do you think it's my fault ?	isn't there something you ...
that's not the question . it's over . do you think that it's my fault ? if I'd ... if I'd ... I never should have taken it . there was no way that I was going to win .	you're talking like a drunk .
that's what I am .	and it's over ... ?
yes .	well , then what are you doing here ?
I ... do you want me to leave ?	you do what you want . you want to leave ... You want to go kill yourself ?
I ...	you want me to tell you it's your fault ? it probably is . what are you going to do about it ? I thought it's not over till the jury comes in .
who told you that ?	you told me so . maybe you'd get some sympathy . you came to the wrong place .
and what makes you so tough ?	maybe I'll tell you later .
is there going to be a later ... ?	not if you don't grow up ...
if I don't' grow up ...'	you're like a kid , you're coming in here like it's Saturday night , you want me to say that you've got a fever -- you don't have to go to school ...

Continental Casualty ...	Mr. Alito , please .

I'm sorry , Sir , we're not allowed ...	... Would you , would you call him up . I'll give you my number , and ask him ...
I can't guarantee that ...	I understand . thank you , my name is Galvin . I'll be at the following number in a half an hour . it's urgent .
Mr. Galvin's ...	let me talk to Mickey .
hello , I'm calling from ...	if you're selling something , I'm late for work ...
I'm calling from Professional Nurse Quarterly ...	from the magazine ?
this is Mr. Wallace in subscriptions ?	how come you're calling me from ... ?
this is Miss Costello ... ?	yes . price ...
Kathy Price .	we find that your subscription lapsed ...
my subscription lapsed three years ago ...	that's why I'm calling , Miss Price ...
missus ...	we have a renew-your-subscription offer ...
we get it at work . we get the magazine at work .	yes , we know that you do . I have it in my files . that's at the Manhattan Health Center ...
Yessir . I'm sorry .	why is that ?
now , have you boys tried to resolve your little difficulty because that certainly would save the Commonwealth a lot of time and bother .	this is a complicated case , your Honor ...
I'm sure it is , Frank : and let me tell you something . if we find it so complex , how in the hell you think you're going to make a jury understand it ? see my point ? let's talk a minute . Frank : what will you and your client take right now this very minute to walk out of here and let this damn thing drop ?	my client can't walk , your Honor .
that's it ... ? come on , guys ... life is too short ... You tell me if you're playing' chicken ,' or you mean it . Frank : I don't think I'm talking out of school , but I just heard someone offer you two hundred grand ... and that's a lot of money ... and if I may say , you haven't got the best of records .	... things change .
I wasn't disbarred , they dropped the pro ...	and it seems to me , a fella's trying to come back , he'd take this settlement , and get a record for himself . I myself would take it and run like a thief .
what is it ?	thank you for seeing me .
that's perfectly all right .	I need an extension for my case .
I had a witness disappear on me .	that happens .
I could subpoena him if I had a week .	I don't have a week . this case never should have come to trial . you know better . you're Mr. independent . you want to be independent ? be independent now . I've got no sympathy for you .
is the Plaintiff ready ?	ready , your Honor .
sustained . yes . the witness will confine his testimony to review of the hospital records .	what ?
yes , Mr. Galvin ?	if I may be permitted to question my own witness in my own way ...
I'm an attorney on trial before the bar . representing my client . my client , do you understand ? you open your mouth and you're losing my case for me .	listen to me , fella ...
no , no , you listen to me . all I wanted in this case is an even shake . you rushed me into court in five days ... my star witness disappears , I can't get a continuance , and I don't give a damn . I'm going up there and I'm going to try it . let the Jury decide . they told me Sweeney he's a hard-ass , he's a defendant's judge . I don't care . I said , the hell with it . the hell with it . I'll take my chances he'll be fair .	Galvin , look , many years ago ...
and don't give me this shit ,' I was a lawyer , too .'' cause I know who you were . you couldn't hack it as a lawyer . you were Bag Man for the Boys and you still are . I know who you are .	are you done ?
damn right I'm done . I'm going to ask for a mistrial and I'm going to request that you disqualify yourself from sitting on this case . I'm going to take a transcript to the State and ask that they impeach your ass .	you aren't going to get a mistrial , boy . we're going back this afternoon , we're going to try this case to an end . now you get out of here before I call the Bailiff and have you thrown in jail .
nothing further , your Honor ...	Mr. Concannon ... ?
I object , your Honor ...	Overruled ...
exception !	noted . thank you . Miss Costello was a rebuttal witness . her sole rebuttal was the document , which has been disallowed ...
I'm Joe Galvin , I'm representing Deborah Ann Kaye , case against St. Catherine Laboure .	I told the guy I didn't want to talk to ...
I'll just take a minute . Deborah Ann Kaye . you know what I'm talking about . the case is going to trial . our chief witness is a Dr. David Gruber , you know who he is ?	no .
he's the Assistant Chief of Anesthesiology , Massachusetts Commonwealth . he says your doctors , Towler and Marx , put my girl in the hospital for life . and we can prove that . what we don't know is why . what went on in there ? in the O.R. That's what we'd like to know . something went wrong . and you know what it was . they gave her the wrong anesthetic . what happened ? the phone rang ... someone got distracted ... what ?	... you got your doctor's testimony . why do you need me ?
I want someone who was in the O.R. We're going to win the case , there's no question of that . it's just a matter of how big ...	I've got nothing to say to you .
you know what happened .	nothing happened .
and ask me what ?	who put my client in the hospital for life .
I didn't do it , Mister .	who are you protecting , then ?
who says that I'm protecting anyone ?	I do . who is it ? the Doctors . what do you owe them ?
I don't owe them a goddamn thing .	then why don't you testify ?
you know , you're pushy , fella ...	you think I'm pushy now , wait' til I get you on the stand ...
well , maybe you better do that , then . you know you guys are all the same . you don't care who gets hurt . you're a bunch of whores . you'd do anything for a dollar . you got no loyalty ... no nothing ... you're a bunch of whores .	Dr. Gruber ...
yes ? Galvin , right ?	I appreciate--a man as busy as--
... Deborah Ann Kaye ...	... Deborah Ann Kaye ...
they called , they're going to settle , what I want to do is build up as much ...	right . who called ?
the Archdiocese called , they want to settle ... her estate ...	... and you're going to do that ?
yes .	you're going to settle out of court ?
yes .	why ?
uh ... in the , well , in the interests of her family ... you , Dr. Gruber , you know , you can never tell what a jury is going to do . St. Catherine's a very well thought of institution . her doctors ...	her doctors killed her .
) I'm sorry ... ?	her doctors murdered her . they gave her the wrong anaesthetic and they put her in the hospital for life . her doctors murdered her .
do you know who her doctors were ?	I read the file . yeah . Marx and Towler . I know who they were .
the most respected ...	whose side are you arguing ... ? I thought that you wanted to do something . I don't have any interest in the woman's' estate' -- No offense , but we all know where the money's going to ... I have an interest in the Hospital ; and I don't want those bozos working in the same shop as me . they gave her the wrong anesthetic . they turned the girl into a vegetable . they killed her and they killed her kid . you caught' em . now : how many others did they kill ?
the hospital is owned by the Archdioceses of ...	what are they going to do ? not invite me to their Birthday party ... ? look , I gotta go . I have to be in Cambridge ...
well , well , when can we meet again . I'd like to get a deposition ..	okay . I'll meet you here . Tuesday night ... I gotta go . you going my way ?
we have to ... we ... we have to keep you under wraps . please don't , don't discuss ...	I understand .
... that's perfectly all right .	uh , why , why are you doing this ?
Dr. Towler ; page 406 ,' Contraindications to general anaesthetic . ideally a patient should refrain from taking nourishment up to nine hours prior to induction of general anaesthetic .' does that sound familiar ?	yes . I wrote it .
&apos; practice and Methodology in Anaesthesia .' General textbook on the subject . is that correct ?	I. Yes . it is .
and you wrote that ...	yes .
... Page 414 ,' If a patient has taken nourishment within one hour prior to inducement , general anaesthetic should be avoided at all costs because of the grave risk the patient will aspirate food particles into his mask .' is that what happened to Deborah Ann Kaye ? she aspirated into her mask ?	she threw up in her mask , yes . but she hadn't eaten one hour prior to admission .
if she had eaten , say one hour prior to admission , the inducement of a general anaesthetic ... the type you gave her ... would have been negligent ... ?	negligent . yes ... it would have been criminal . but that was not the case .
Dr. Thompson ... ?	it was good of you to meet ...
I have some errands to run , and then I thought we'd spend the evening ...	that's what I'd planned to ...
I'm going to take you to the home to see the girl ...	from what I've seen , Mr. Galvin , you have a very good case ...
yes . yes . I think so . I hope you'll be comfortable . I'm putting you up at my ...	... I made a reservation at ...
... apartment . no , no . please . you don't know who we're dealing with , I , please believe me , they ...	... What difference would ...
these people play very rough . they don't want to lose this case . there's a lot of pressure they can bring to bear , I ...	there's nothing they can do to me .
cardiac arrest . during delivery her heart stopped . when the heart stops the brain's deprived of oxygen . you get brain damage . that is why she's in the state she's in today .	now , Dr. Towler's testified that they restored the heartbeat within three or four minutes . in your opinion is his estimate correct ?
I didn't do too well for you .	no , you did fine .
I'm afraid that's not true . will you want me to stay on till Monday ?	no . no thank you , Doctor . you go home .
you know ... sometimes people can surprise you . sometimes they have a great capacity to hear the truth .	yes ... I ... yes .
you sure you don't want me to stay on .	no . no . thank you . you go home .
are you saying that a failure to restore the heartbeat within nine minutes in itself constitutes bad medical practice ?	well ...
then you're saying there's no negligence , based on my question ?	I ... given the limits of your question , that's correct .
the Doctors were not negligent .	I ... um ...
they gave her the wrong anesthetic .	why is that ?
her sister said she ate one hour prior to admittance ... she ...	... that's what the sister said . the chart said she ate nine hours prior to ...
... she went in complaining of stomach cramps . good doctor would have doubted the information on the chart .	is that what a good doctor would do ? how old are you , please ?
what qualifies you as an expert in anesthetics ?	I am on the staff of ...
Easthampton Hospital for Women . excuse me , what is that , a joke ? let me tell you something , Doctor , those men at Catherine Laboure . men who are known not only in this city , but the world , were trying to save a woman's life . they were there , and here you are , four years later , read some hospital report , and say ...	... I made a detailed physical examination of the patient , Sir , yesterday evening , I ...
she getting good care over there ?	actually , yes . it's by no means bad , I ...
then what good would it do to ruin the reputation of two men , to help a girl whose life's not going to be changed in the least ? you know what CODE BLUE means ?	&apos; code Blue' ...
please sit down . I told your wife . I'm sorry that we have to meet out here . I've got a case coming in two days in the Superior Court and my office is a mess of papers .	... that's all right .
... the Archdiocese called up , they said who was our attorney ,' cause the case is coming to trial ...	I doubt we'll have to go to trial ...
... we told them we didn't want it to come out this way .	I completely understand ...
what is this going to cost ?	it's completely done on a contingency basis . that means whatever the settlement is I retain one-third ... that is , of course , the usual arrangement ...
you said you're gonna call me up . you didn't call me up . who do you think you are ? who do you think you are ... ?	hold on a second .
I'm going to have you disbarred . I'm going to have your ticket . you know what you did ? do you know what you did ?	it's all right , Mickey .
you ruined my life , Mister ... Me and my wife ... and I am going to ruin yours ... You don't have to go out there to see that girl . we been going four years . four years ... my wife's been crying herself to sleep what they , what , what they did to her sister .	I swear to you I wouldn't have turned the offer down unless I thought that I could win the case ...
what you thought ! ? what you thought ... I'm a workingman , I'm trying to get my wife out of town , we hired you , we're paying you , I got to find out from the other side they offered two hundred ...	I'm going to win this case ... Mist ... Mr. Doneghy ... I'm going to the Jury with a solid case , a famous doctor as an expert witness , and I'm going to win eight hundred thousand dollars .
you guys , you guys , you're all the same . the Doctors at the hospital , you ... it's' What I'm going to do for you' ; but you screw up it's' We did the best that we could . I'm dreadfully sorry ...' And people like me live with your mistakes the rest of our lives .	if I could accept the offer right now , I would . they took it back .
you are aware of the penalties for perjury ... ?	it's a crime .
I wouldn't do it .	you would not ... ?
no .	in fact , you've just taken an oath that you would not commit perjury . you've just sworn to that . isn't that right ?
yes .	just now ...
yes .	... sworn before God you would tell the truth ?
yes .	now . I'd like to ask you something : four years ago , when you were working as a nurse , are you aware that Drs. Towler and Marx based their treatment of Deborah Ann Kaye on this chart that you signed . . . ?
I . . ..	and wasn't that an oath ... ? these are your initials here : K.C. When you signed this chart you took an oath . no less important than that which you took today . isn't that right ? isn't that right ... ?
I ... yes .	then , please , which is correct ? you've sworn today the patient ate one hour ago . four years ago you swore she ate nine hours ago ? which is the lie . when were you lying ?
I ...	you know these doctors could have settled out of court . they wanted a trial . they wanted to clear their names .
they lied .	&apos; they lied .' indeed ! when did they lie ? and do you know what a lie is ?
I do . yes .	you swore on this form that the patient ate nine hours ago .
that's not my handwriting .	you've just said you signed it .
yes , I , yes , I signed it , yes . but I , I didn't write that figure .	you didn't write that figure . and how is it that you remember that so clearly after four years ?
... what in the world would induce you to make a photocopy of some obscure record and hold it fouryears ? this is a ... why ? why would you do that ?	I thought I would need it .
and why , please tell us , would you think that ?	after , after the operation , when that poor girl , she went in a coma . Dr. Towler called me in . he told me he had five difficult deliveries in a row and he was tired , and he never looked at the admittance form . and he told me to change the form . he told me to change the one to a nine . or else , or else , he said ... He said he'd fire me . he said I'd never work again .... Who were these men ... ? who were these men ... ? I wanted to be a nurse ...
your Honor , Bishop Brophy and the Archdiocese have offered plaintiff two hundred and ten thousand dollars .	huh !
Mr. Concannon ... ?	nothing further , your Honor .
objection ! this is ri ... expect us to accept a photocopy , we have the original right ...	I'll rule on that presently . proceed .
no further questions .	you may step down .
thank you , your Honor . we object to the copy of the admissions form as incompetemt and essentially hearsay evidence and cite McGee versus State of Indiana , U.S. 131 point 2 and 216 through 25 of the Uniform Code :' the admission of a duplicate document in preference to an existing original must presuppose the possibility of alteration and so must be disallowed .' and , your Honor , having given the Plaintiff the leeway we would like your ruling on this issue now : we object to the admission of the Xerox form .	... one moment , Mr. Concannon ...
the document is disallowed , the jury will be advised not to consider the testimony of Kathy Costello regarding the Xerox form . it's unsubstantiated and we can't accept a copy in preference to the original ...	thank you , your Honor . further : Ms. Costello is a rebuttal witness . as a' surprise witness' she may only serve to rebut direct testimony . as her only evidentiary rebuttal was the admitting form , which has been disallowed I request that her entire testimony be disallowed and the jury advised that they must totally disregard her appearance here .
I'm going to uphold that .	Dr. Thompson , just so the Jury knows , you never treated Deborah Ann Kaye . is that correct ?
that is correct . I was engaged to render an opinion .	engaged to render an opinion . for a price . is that correct ? you're being paid to be here today ?
just as you are , Sir ...	are you board-certified in anesthesiology , Doctor ?
no , I am not . it's quite common in New York State ...	... I'm sure it is , but this is Massachusetts , Doctor . certified in Internal Medicine ?
no .	Neurology ?
no .	Orthopedics ?
I'm just an M.D.	do you know Dr. Robert Towler ... ?
I know of him .	how is that ?
through , through his book .	what book is that ?
meth ... Methodology and Technique ...	... of Anesthesiology ?
&apos; Methodology and Techniques of Anesthesiology .' yes .	how old are you ?
I am seventy-four years old .	Uh-huh . still practice a lot of medicine ?
I'm on the staff of ...	yes , we've heard that . doctor : you testify quite a bit against other physicians ? isn't that right ? you , you're available for that ? when you're paid to be there ?
sir . yes . when a thing is wrong ... as in this case , I am available . I am seventy-four years old , I am not board-certified . I have been practicing medicine for forty-six years and I know when an injustice has been done .	do you , indeed . I'll bet you do . fine . fine . we'll save the court the time . we will admit the Doctor as an' expert witness ,' fine .
I did .	objection .
Ed Concannon .	Frank Galvin . we've met before .
objection , we've ...	... to get her heartbeat back ... ?
we've touched on this , his own witness has said ...	... almost nine minutes ... causing brain damage .
objection !	and you would come here , and on a slip of memory four years ago , you'd ruin their lives .
no , actually , she was referred to me . she was Dr. Hagman's patient ...	don't equivocate . be positive . just tell the truth .
whatever the' truth' is , let's hear that . you were her doctor .	yes .
say it .	I was her doctor .
you were the anesthesiologist at her delivery May twelfth , nineteen seventy ...	... I was one of a group of ...
answer affirmatively . simply . keep those answers to three words . you weren't' part of a group ,' you were her anesthesiologist . isn't that right ?	yes .
you were there to help Dr. Marx deliver her baby . were you not ?	yes .
anything special about the case ?	when she ...
thank you . when Debby ...	Dr. Towler , who was in the operating room with you ?
we went to Code Blue ...	&apos; code Blue ,' what does that mean ... ?
it's a common medical expression , it's a crash program to restore the heartbeat . Dr. Marx cut an Airway in her trachea , to get her oxygen , her and the baby ... Ms.Nevins ...	why wasn't she getting oxygen ... ?
well , many reasons , actually ...	tell me one ?
she'd aspirated vomitus into her mask ...	she threw UP IN HER mask . let's cut the bullshit . say it : she threw UP IN HER mask .
that's right .	and what did your team do ...
well , we ...	... You brought thirty years of medical experience to bear . isn't that what you did ?
yes .	... A patient riddled with complications , questionable information on her , on her admitting form ...
... We did everything we could ...	... to save her and to save the baby . is that ...
yes !	you reached down into death . now , isn't that right ?
my God , we tried to save her ... You can't know ... You can't know ...	tell us .
what are you doing here ?	Mickey told me to come back to work .
... yes . get her on the phone ...	... that was a Dr. David Gruber's office ...
Gruber ...	Mickey told him to call .' he's some very hotshot surgeon at Mass . Commonwealth . he wants to meet with you at seven tonight re testimony in the case of Deborah Ann Kaye . you meet him at the hospital .'
... he wants to testify ... ?	it looks that way .
you know what that would mean ? to get somebody from a Boston hospital to say he'll testify ?	... a Mrs. Doneghy called ... I told you that .
this is going to drive the ante up .	Frank Galvin's ... who's calling please ? Bishop Brophy's office ...
that's the call that I'm waiting for .	what does it mean ?
they want to settle . it means a lot of money .	does that mean I'm back for awhile ?
it's a generous offer , Mr. Galvin ... ... nothing can make the woman well ... but we try to compensate ... to make a gesture ...	how did you settle on the amount ?
we thought it was just .	you thought it was just .
yes .	because it struck me how neatly' three' went into the amount . two Hundred Ten Thousand . that would mean I keep seventy .
that was our insurance company's recommendation .	yes . it would be .
nothing that we can do can make that woman well .	and no one will know the truth .
what is the truth ?	that that poor girl put her trust in the hands of two men who took her life , she's in a coma , her life is gone . she has no family , she has no home , she's tied to a machine , she has no friends --and the people who should care for her : her Doctors , and you , and me , have been bought off to look the other way . we have been paid to look the other way . I came in here to take your money . I brought snapshots to show you . so I could get your money . I can't take it . if I take it . if I take that money I'm lost . I'm just going to be a rich ambulance chaser . I can't do it . I can't take it .
he was accused of jury tampering .	accused . not indicted . he resigned the firm . divorced nineteen seventy . Galvin worked with Michael Morrissey until Morrissey retired in' seventy-eight . since then he's been on his own . four cases before the Circuit Court . he lost them all . he drinks .
four cases in three years ...	the man's an ambulance chaser ...
... tell me about this case .	this is a nuisance suit . he's looking for small change . he's asking for six hundred thousand and betting we don't want to go to court .
no -- we don't want this case in court .	neither does he . that's where he loses . this man's scared to death to go to court . we only have to call his bluff .
I want to settle this thing and be done with it . I don't want the Archdiocese exposed .	no . absolutely , and we're going to see that it is not .
so what I want to do is stop it here . I'm going to make him an offer . I want to do it myself . I want it to come from me .	all right . but let's keep the price down . I've called Ed Concannon . he recommends that we continue to respond as if we're going to trial .
if we were to go to trial , would we win the case ?	well , of course , it's always dangerous ...
I know that answer . if we went to trial would we win ?	yes .
why did he go to see Mary Rooney ?	she's the only nurse who isn't testifying for the Doctors .
what did he find ?	nothing .
how good's your intelligence ?	very good .
and so what is the rest of his case aside from Dr. Thompson ?	as far as we know , nothing .
Mr. Abraham ...	Abrams ...
Abrams . yes . how are you today ?	I'm fine .
good . you ever been inside a hospital ?	yes .
my client offers his full cooperation in these proceedings . in exchange , his testimony is to be sealed and all matters incriminating to himself are to be rendered inadmissible .	the district attorney's office will comply provided -
no provisions , nothing . my clients testimony for his immunity .	May-I be frank , Counselor ? I suspect your political power as much as I respect it . I don't know why Mr. Kint has so many faceless allies in City Hall , and I don't care . the embarrassment he helped cause the city of New York will not happen here .
counselor , I will prosecute your client .	then prosecute . I will be very impressed to see if the District Attorney manages to bring in twenty-seven simultaneous counts of murder against one man with cerebral palsy . I would think a man with your job would agree with these alleged &amp; quot ; faceless people in City Hall &amp; quot ; you mention .
I' 11 take my chances then . I' 11 feel safer without a job if a man like Mr. Kint is behind bars .	Mr. Kint will plead guilty to weapons possession .
you're joking .	weapons . Misdemeanor one .
counselor , you're insulting me .	counselor , you're bluffing . shall I push for misdemeanor two ?
verbal , you know we're trying to help you .	sure . and I appreciate that . and I want to help you , Agent Kujan . I like cops . I would have liked to have been a Fed myself but my C.P. was -
verbal , I know you know something . I know you're not telling us everything .	I told the D.A. everything I know .
I know you liked Keaton I know you think he was a good man .	I know he was good .
he was a corrupt cop , verbal .	sure . fifteen years ago , but he was a good thief Anyway , the cops wouldn't let him go legit .
Keaton was a piece of shit .	you trying to get a rise out of me , Agent Kujan ?
according to your statement you are a short-con operator . run of the mill seams . everything you do , you learned from somebody else .	that's been suppressed . anything in there is inadmissible .
oh , I know . sweet deal you have . total immunity .	well I do have the weapons charge . I'm looking at six whole months hard time .
you know a dealer named Ruby Deemer , verbal ?	you know a religious guy named John Paul ?
you know Ruby is in Attica ?	he didn't have my lawyer .
there's nothing in there about Ruby .	I' 11 be sure to mention that to him .
the first thing I learned on the job , know what it was ? how to spot a murderer . let's say you arrest three guys for the same killing . put them all in jail overnight . the next morning , whoever is sleeping is your man . if you're guilty , you know you're caught , you get some rest - let your guard down , you follow ?	no .
I' 11 get right to the point . I'm smarter than you . I' 11 find out what I want to know and I' 11 get it from you whether you like it or not .	I'm not a rat .
heartwarming . really , I feel weepy .	you wanted to know what happened after the line-up , I'm telling you .
oh come on , verbal . who do you think you're talking to ? you really expect me to believe he retired ? for a woman ? bullshit . he was using her .	he loved her .
sure . and I'm supposed to believe that hitting the Taxi Service wasn't his idea	that was all Fenster and McManus .
come on . Keaton was a cop for four years . who else would know the Taxi Service	you keep trying to lay this whole ride on t Keaton . it wasn't like that . sure he knew , but Edie had him all turned around. r I'm telling you straight , I swear . +
let me tell you something . I know Dean Keaton . I've been investigating him for three years . the guy I know is a cold- + blooded bastard . L.A.P.D. indicted him on three counts of murder before he was kicked off the force , so don't sell me the hooker with the heart of gold . +	you got him wrong .
I don't know about that .	I don't think you do . but you say you saw Keaton die . I think you're covering his ass and he's still out there somewhere . I think he was behind that whole circus in the harbor . my bet is he's using you because you're stupid and you think he's your friend . you tell me he's dead , so be it . I want to make sure he's dead before I go back to New York .
he wasn't behind anything . it was the lawyer .	what lawyer ?
you think I don't know you held out on the D.A. ? what did you leave out of that testimony ? I can be on the phone to Ruby Deemer in ten minutes .	the D.A. gave me immunity .
not FROM ME , YOU PIECE OF SHIT . there IS NO IMMUNITY FROM ME . you atone with me or the world you live in becomes the hell you fear in the back of your tiny mind . every criminal I have put in prison ,	there was a lawyer . Kobayashi .
is he the one that killed Keaton ?	no . but I'm sure Keaton's dead .
so this lawyer ...	Kobayashi .
came from Redfoot .	right .
do you believe in him , verbal ?	Keaton always said : &amp; quot ; I don't believe in God , but I'm afraid of him . &amp; quot ; Well I believe in God , and the only thing that scares me is Keyser SOZE .
I came clean . I told it like it happened on the boat . so what if I left out how I got there ? it's got so many holes in it , the D.A. would've told me to blow amnesty out my ass . so you got what you wanted out of me . big fucking deal .	and this is why you never told the D.A.
you tell me , Agent Kujan . if I told you the Loch Ness Monster hired me to hit the harbor , what would you say ?	turn state's evidence . take the stand on this and we'll hear it out .
I've got immunity now . what can you possibly offer me ?	if there is a Keyser Soze he'll be looking for you .
where's your head , Agent Kujan ? where do you think the pressure's coming from ? Keyser Soze - or whatever you want to call him - knows where I am right now . he's got the front burner under' your ass to let me go so he can scoop me up ten minutes later . Immunity was just to deal with you assholes . I got a whole new problem when I post bail .	so why play into his hands ? we can protect you .
that was how I ended up in a barber shop quartet in Skokie , Illinois .	this is totally irrelevant .
oh , but it's not . if I hadn't been nailed in Illinois for running a three card Monte in between sets , I never would have took off for New York . I never would have met Keaton , see . that barber shop quartet was the reason for everything .	can we just get back to Kobayashi ?
the quartet is part of the bit about Kobayashi . the quartet was in my file , along with every other thing I had done since high school , see ? aliases , middle- men . they knew me better than I did . they knew all of us .	you're stalling , verbal .
give a guy a break , huh ?	what happened ?
then what ?	McManus was furious . he was talking about tracking him down and ripping his heart out and all sorts of shit . that night we got the call .
I wanted to . I thought we could make it .	why didn't you say anything ?
a man in a suit with a slim build . tall .	wait a minute .
don't shine me , verbal . no more stalling . you know what I'm getting at .	I don't .
I don't know what you're talking about .	you KNOW . you'VE known THIS WHOLE FUCKING TIME . give IT TO ME .
I don't understand what you're saying . I saw Keaton get shot , I swear to you .	then why didn't you help him ?
I WAS AFRAID , OKAY ? somehow , I was sure it was Keyser Soze at that point . I couldn't bring myself to raise my gun to him .	but Keaton ...
he was a stool pigeon for the Justice Department . he swore out a statement to Federal Marshals that he had seen and could positively identify one Keyser Soze and had intimate knowledge of his business , including , but not exclusive to , drug trafficking and murder .	I never heard of him .
his own people were selling him to a gang of Hungarians . most likely the same Hungarians that sate all but wiped out back in Turkey . the money wasn't there for dope . the Hungarians were going to buy the one guy that could finger Soze for them .	I said I never heard of him .
but Keaton had . Edie Finneran was his extradition advisor . she knew who he was and what he knew .	I don't
there were no drugs on that boat . it was a hit . a suicide mission to whack out the one man that could finger Keyser Soze so sate had a few thieves put to it . men he knew he could march into certain death .	but how - wait . you're saying SOZE sent t us to kill someone ?
he wanted me to live .	why did he want you to live ? a one-time dirty cop without a loyalty in the world finds it in his heart to save a worthless rat-cripple ? no , sir . why'
Edie .	I don't buy that reform story for a minute . and even if I did , I certainly don't believe he would send you to protect her . so why ?
because he was my friend .	no , verbal . you weren't friends . Keaton didn't have friends . he saved you because he wanted it that way . it was his will .
no ...	Keaton was Keyser Soze
no , NO , NO , NO , NO .	the kind OF MAN THAT COULD HAVE KILLED Edie FINNERAN .
Edie ...	he used all of you to get him on that boat . he couldn't get on alone and he had to pull the trigger himself to make sure he got his man . the one man that could identify him .
this is all bullshit .	he left you to stay behind and tell us he was dead . you saw him die , right ? or did you ? you had to hide when the first police cars showed up . you heard the shot , just before the fire but you didn't see him die .
I knew him . he would never -	he programmed you to tell us just what he wanted you to . Customs has been
if he's dead , verbal - if what you say is true , then it won't matter . it was his idea to hit the Taxi Service in New York , wasn't it ? tell me the truth .	it was all Keaton . we followed him from the beginning .
I didn't know . I saw him die . I believe he's dead . Christ	why lie about everything else , then ?
you know what it's like , Agent Kujan , to know you'll never be good ? not good like you . you got good all fucked around . I mean a stand up guy . I grew up knowing I was never going to be good at anything' cause I was a cripple . shit , I wasn't	you're not safe on your own .
you think he's .. ?	is he Keyser Soze I don't know , verbal . it seems to me that Keyser sate is a shield . like you said , a spook story , but I know Keaton - and someone out there is pulling strings for you . stay here and let us protect you .
you posted twenty minutes ago . Captain Leo wants you out of here a.s.a.p. , unless you turn state's .	I' 11 take my chances , thank you . it's tougher to buy the cheapest bag-man than it is to buy a cop .
where are you going to go , verbal ? you gonna run ? turn states evidence . you might never see trial . if somebody wants to get you , you know They'll get you out there .	maybe so , but I'm no rat , Agent Kujan . you tricked me , that's all . I won't keep my mouth shut' cause I'm scared . I' 11 keep it shut' cause I let Keaton down by getting caught - Edie Finneran too . and if they kill me , it's
even if I was to let you talk to him , he won't talk to you . he's paranoid about being recorded and he knows the interrogation rooms are wired	this won't be an' interrogation , just a ... friendly chat to kill time .
no , no , no , no , no .	if it was a dope deal , where's the dope , if it was a hit , who called it in ?
and I am sure you have a host of wild + theories to answer these questions .	you know damn well what I think .
that's crazy , Dave and it doesn't matter . he has total immunity and his story checks out . he doesn't know what you want to know .	I don't think he does . not exactly , but there's a lot more to his story . I want to know why twenty-seven men died on that pier for what looks to be ninety-one million dollars worth of dope that wasn't there . above all , I want to be sure that Dean Keaton is dead .
his name was Arturo Marquez . a petty smuggler out of Argentina . he was arrested in New York last year for trafficking . he escaped to California and got picked up in Long Beach . they were setting up his extradition when he escaped again . get this - Edie Finneran was called in to advise the proceedings .	Kobayashi .
what do you mean I can't see him ?	the D.A. came down here last night ready to arraign before they even moved him to county . Kint's lawyer comes in and five minutes later , the D.A. comes out looking like he'd been bitch-slapped by the boogey man . they took his statement and cut him a deal .
did they charge him with anything ?	weapons . Misdemeanor two .
two hours , tops .	I want to see him .
he won't go into the interrogation room .	someplace else , then .
where ?	I know what I wanted to know about Keaton .
no matter . he'll have to know how close we came .	Keyser sate or not , if Keaton's alive he'll never come up again .
I' 11 find him .	waste of time .
a rumor is not a rumor that doesn't die .	what ?
nothing . something I - forget it .	we're on vacation .
take your time . enjoy L.A.	a friend of mine in New York tells me you knew spook Hollis .
I hear you did time with old spook . yeah , he was a good egg . I used to run a lot of dope for him . fuckin' shame he got shivved .	I shivved him .
better you hear it from me now than somebody else later .	business or personal ?
get a grip . I didn't know .	you didn't know .
the job got thrown to me by this lawyer .	who is he ?
some Limey . he's a middle-man for somebody . he doesn't say and I don't ask .	we want to meet him .
he wants to meet you . he called last night and asked me to set it up . what do I tell him'	tell him we'll meet .
my employer requires your services . one job . one day's work . very dangerous . I don't expect all of you to live , but those who do will have ninety-one million dollars to divide any way they see fit .	who's your boss ?
my employer wishes to remain anonymous .	don't jerk me off . we all know what this is . you don't work with me if I work with you without knowing who I'm working for . now let's cut the shit . who's the man ?
I work for Keyser sate .	you set up the line-up .
Mr. Soze made a few calls , yes . you were not to be released until I came to see you . it seems Mr. Keaton's attorney , Ms. Finneran , was a bit too effective in expediting his release . holding the rest of you became a moot point .	what about Redfoot ?
the answer is no .	Mr. Soze will be most -
listen to me , cocksucker . there is no Keyser sate . if you say his name again , I' 11 kill you right here .	a strange threat . I can only assume you're here to kill me anyway . pity about Mr. Redfoot .
ahh , Mr. Hockney . do join us .	we know you can get to us , and now you know we can get to you . I'm offering you the chance to call this off .
Mr. so- My employer has made up his mind . he does not change it .	neither do we .
I am sorry , Mr. McManus. f implore you to believe me , Mr. Keaton . Mr. Soze is very real and very + determined .	we'll see .
what did you say ?	Edie Finneran . she is upstairs in my office for an extradition deposition . I requested she be put on the case personally . she flew out yesterday .
no matter . kill away , Mr. McManus .	you're lying .
am I ? 92 92 INT . hallway - fiftieth floor	how are you , Keaton ?
I'd have to say my spine was broken , Keyser .	ready ?
let's say for example -	this I had to see myself .
with what ?	you know damn well , dead-man .
county . I was in for fraud .	you were waiting for a line-up then , too . what happened with that ?
what the hell do you want ?	I wanted to talk to you . the other guys -
I did you a favor by standing up for you last night , but don't think we're friends . I'm sorry , but I have other things -	they're gonna do a job . three million dollars , maybe more .
get out .	if you'll just let me -
don't hurt me .	hurt you , you sonofabitch ? I could kill you .
they - That's bullshit . they don't operate anymore .	McManus has a friend in the fourteenth Precinct . they're coming out for one job - Thursday . they're picking up a guy smuggling emeralds out of South America . Fenster and McManus have a fence set to take the stuff .
what fence ? who ?	some guy in California . his name is Redfoot .
never heard of him .	you have to come .
what's with you ? what do you care whether I come or not ?	they - They don't know me . you do . they won't take me unless you go . look at me . I need this .
you watch your mouth .	okay , okay . you say it's the real thing ? that's cool .
I was out of line .	you okay ?
I' 11 be alright .	well , I'm sorry .
forget it . I' 11 probably shit blood tonight .	how are they going to do it ?
McManus wants to go in shooting . I said no way .	Fenster and Hockney ?
they're pretty pissed off . they'll do anything . now I got a way to do it without killing anyone : but like I said , they won't let me in without you .	three million ?
maybe more .	no killing ?
not if we do it my way .	we'll make it .
don't do this . send her a card - something .	we'll make it .
what is it Keaton ?	something - I don't know . I ever tell you about the restaurant I wanted to open ?
what is this ?	who's Keyser Soze ?
What-are they speaking ?	Russian , I think . I don't know .
Keaton , I can't just -	I want you to find Edie . both of you find some place safe . tell her what happened - Everything . she knows people . she'll know what to do . if we can't get Kobayashi my way , she'll get him her way .
what if I	just do what I tell you .
I know you . you don't think I know you're on the take . this whole fucking precinct is dirty . you don't have a fucking leg to stand on .	Hockney was just a bad bastard . good with explosives . mean as a snake when it mattered .
me too .	did you hear what he just said ?
you heard right .	the word I got is you hung up your spurs , man . what's that all about ?
he's alright .	how do I know that ? how about it , pretzel-man ? what's your story ?
Keaton , we gotta go . they're gonna find him .	dig .
it's a logistical nightmare . close quarters , no advance layout , ten men , maybe twenty .	can we Stealth these guys ?
you're fuckin' A right , no P.C. Well screw P.C. No right . no goddamn right . you do some time , they never let you go . treat me like a criminal , I'll end up a criminal .	you are a criminal .
I'm sure you can understand my hesitation .	then who goes ?
don'T MOVE , YOU fuckers .	right THERE . freeze .
everybody I ever worked with , did time with .	they fucking know everything .
it's bullshit . this guy could be L.A.P.D. I think it's a setup .	the way I hear it , Soze is some kind of butcher . no pity .
I'd say you've gotten on his main and central nerve , McManus .	do your friend a favor , Fenster , keep him quiet .
forget him . it's not important . I was trying to make a point .	this whole thing was a shakedown .
how many times have you been in a line- up ? it's always you and four dummies . the P.D. pays homeless guys ten bucks a head half the time . no way they'd line five felons in the same row . no way . and what the hell is a voice line-.up ? a public defender could get you off of that .	so why the hell was I hauled in and cavity searched tonight ?
it was the Feds . a truck load of guns gets snagged , Customs comes down on N.Y.P.D. for some answers - they come up with us . they're grabbing at straws . it's politics - nothing you can do .	I had a guy's fingers in my asshole tonight .
fuck you . I' 11 never shit right again . so who did it ? own up .	I don't want to know .
this is not right .	I don't know . who was that guy that used to talk about Soze in New York ?
come on . the guy is a pipe dream . this Kobayashi is using him for window dressing .	I don't know . this is bad .
I know who he is .	I hope I didn't disturb you .
so what is it you do , Mr. Kint ?	umm ...
now remember , this is another kind of business . they don't earn your respect . you owe it to them . don't stare them down but don't look away either . confidence . they are fools not to trust you . that's the attitude .	I'm having a stroke .
... and the desk Sergeant is actually trying to tell me he can't release you ? can you believe that ? you weren't even charged . new York police - Jesus . I want to take pictures of your face to bring to the D.A. first thing in the morning .	just forget about it .
I' 11 have this thing in front of a grand jury by Monday .	Edie , please . I don't want to hear this right now . what did Renault and Fortier say ?
they want more time to think about investing .	goddamnit .
they just said they wanted time .	time for what , Edie ? time to look into me a little more , that's what . no matter how well you cover my tracks now , they'll find out who I am .
give me some credit . I got you this far , let's go to the grand jury . this is never going to stop if we -	no . it's never going to stop , period . it won't take more than a week before every investor in this city is walking away from us . it's finished . I'm finished .
don't give up on me now , Dean .	they'll never stop .
I love you .	they ruined me tonight .
come home , Dean .	alright .
that's enough , Edie .	I don't know what you came here for , but we won't have any part of it .
Edie , please .	&amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; We were there to buy a man and take him back to Hungary . &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ;
not dope . something else . some what ? .. He doesn't knob what they were buying . but not dope ... people .	&amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; I'll tell you everything . I' 11 even say it slow enough for you to understand it . just tell this man I want protection . real protection . &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ;
&amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; No , no , no . I need a guarantee from the ridiculous man . I am going to be killed . I have seen the Devil and looked him in the eye . &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ;	no good . he needs guarantees . he says ... his life is in danger ... He has seen the Devil ... looked him in the eye .
&amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; Keyser Soze . Keyser sate . I've seen his face . I see it when I close my eyes . &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ;	he says he knows his face . he sees it when he closes his eyes .
&amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; It was smaller than that . sharper . &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ;	+ The nose is sharper . smaller too . + &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; And what about the hair ? you said something earlier about it . &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ;
&amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; It is longer than that . and not so dark . &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ;	&amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; Are you sure ? &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ;
&amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; Don't be stupid . &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ;	he says the hair is longer and lighter .
Jack . what are you doing here ?	I've been looking all over for you . you still after the coke that walked out of that blood bath in the harbor ?
yeah .	you can stop looking . there was no coke . I've been in L.A. county with a guy they
there was ninety-one million -	we know , but our man says no way on the dope . this Hungarian tells me the whole bunch was pulling stumps for Turkey the next' day . they had no time to negotiate that kind of product and no means to move it .
what was the money for ?	he didn't know . no one doing the deal knew except a few key people . this guy says they were real hush about it . whatever it was it was highly sensitive .
I don't get it .	they tell me you got the cripple from New York in there . he mention Keyser Soze

I'll bet anything he won't go to town nor he won't ride out on the range . right off he'll hole up at the ranch .	I ain't waitin' , Bill . I'll look in on your youngsters when I get back .
I ... I ... think I'm ... shot .	you ain't shot .
P-p-p-please , I'm not armed . M-m-my G-god . you killed ... Little Bill .	you sure you ain't armed ?
I never c-c-carry arms . I'm ... a writer .	a writer ? what do you write ... letters an' such ?
B-b-books . you ... you killed five men ... singlehanded .	yeah .
Wh-wh-who did you kill first ?	huh ?

yeah , I guess so .	like I was sayin' you don't look like no meaner than hell cold-blooded damn killer .
maybe I ain't .	well , Uncle Pete said you was the goddamndest meanest sonofabitch ever lived an' if I ever wanted a partner for a killin' , you was the worst one . meanin' the best . on account of you're cold as snow an' don't have no weak nerve nor fear .
he said that , huh ?	I'm a damn killer myself , only I ain't killed so many as you because of my youth . Schofield Kid , they call me .
Schofield ? you from Schofield ?	on account of my Schofield model Smith and Wesson pistol .
oh .	well , how about it ?

Jesus !	thousand dollars of reward . five hundred a piece .
I ain't like that no more , Kid . whiskey done it as much as anythin' I guess . I ain't touched a drop in ten years . my wife , she cured me of it ... cured me of drink an' wickedness .	well ... you don't look so prosperous . hell , you could buy her a new dress out of your half . we could kill them two an' you could buy your wife one of them fancy ...

Uncle Pete told me he never seen nothin' like it , shootin' your way out of a scrape like that .

that was ... the first one .	first one what ?
first one I ever killed .	yeah ?
how I said I shot five men ... it wasn't true . that Mexican ... the one that come at me with a knife ... I busted his leg with a shovel ... I didn't shoot him or nothin' .	well , that fella today , you shot him alright .
H-hell yeah . I killed the hell out of him ... three shots ... he was takin' a sh-sh-shit an' ... an' ...	take a drink , Kid .
oh Ch-ch-christ ... it don't ... it don't seem ... real ... How he's ... DEAD ... how he ain't gonna breathe no more ... n-n-never . or the other one neither ... On account of ... of just ... pullin' a trigger .	it's a hell of a thing , ain't it , killin' a man . you take everythin' he's got ... an' everythin' he's ever gonna have ...
well , I gu-guess they had it ... comin' .	we all got it comin' , Kid .
I trust you , Bill .	well , you don't wanna trust me too much . we'll take Ned his share together so you don't figure I run off with it .
wha ... what f-for ?	Lemmee see it .
you ... gonna take ... the money ?	you better get on back , Miss .
you could have it . all of it .	I thought you wanted to buy spectacles an' fancy clothes an' all .
this here money , take my share an' Ned's an' leave it with my youngsters . tell' em half goes to Sally Two trees if I ain't back in a week . the rest is yours ... you could buy them spectacles .	are you ... Are you gonna ... kill Little Bill ?

I was watchin' you ... seein' if you was followed .	Silky an' Faith , they rode off to the East an' two deputies was followin' them .
yeah , he went South ahead of us . I guess we'll catch him before ...	he's ... he's dead .
no he ain't . he went South yesterday .	they ... they killed him . I ... thought you know that . I thought you knew because ...
little Bill . the ... the Bar T boys caught him and Little Bill ...	he hanged him ? shot him down ?
N-no . he ... he beat him up . he was making him ... answer questions ... and beating him up ... and then ... Ned just died . little Bill didn't mean to kill him ... he said he was sorry an' all ... but he said it was a good example anyhow .	good example ! good example of what I'd like to know ? he didn't even kill nobody ... he couldn't do it no more .
they got ... a sign on him says he was a killer .	a sign on him ?
"in front of Greely's . it says , "" This here is what happens to ... """	they got a sign on him in front of Greely's ?
the questions Little Bill asked him ... what sort of questions was they ?	about where you an' him was ... an' where you was from ... an' what your names was ... an' ...
what'd Ned say ?	L-lies ... at first . about how you was just passin' through and didn't kill nobody ... an' Little Bill kept askin' questions , mixin' him up , catchin' lies ... an' then he'd beat on Ned an' Ned would cry and lie some more an' then ... then ...
then ... what ?	a cowboy come in sayin' you killed Quick Mike in the shit house at the Bar T ...
an' Little Bill killed Ned for what I done ?	not on purpose . but he started hurtin' him worse ... makin' him tell stuff . first Ned wouldn't say nothin' ... but Little Bill hurt him so bad he said who you was ...
"he said how you was really Three fingered Jack out of Missouri ... an' Bill said "" Same Three fingered Jack that dynamited the Rock Island and Pacific in' 69 killin' women and children an' all ? "" an' Ned says you done a lot worse than that , said you was more cold blooded than William Bonney or Clay Alisson or the James Brothers an' how if he hurt Ned again you was gonna come an' kill him like you killed a U.S. Marshall in' 73 ."	didn't scare Little Bill though , did it ?
N-no , sir ?	Lemmee see that Schofield , Kid .
you work for the railroads too , Mister Beauchamp ?	N-no . I wr-wr-wr-write ... I wr- wrwrite ...
it's only a b-b-b-book ...	a book , huh ? I guess that means you can read ... An' I guess you boys seen them signs about surrendering your firearms ... But then , like you told old Andy there , you ain't armed , are you , Bob ?
the ... Duck of Death .	D-d-d-duke . the D-d-duke of Death .
that is you there , ain't it , Bob ? the Duck of Death ?	uh ... Duke .
uh ... It's ... uh ... generally considered desirable in the publishing business to ... ah ... take certain license in depicting the cover scene ... for ... ah ... purposes involving the ... ah , market place .	well , Mister Beauchamp ... from what I read of this here book , I'd have to say the writin' ain't a whole lot different from the pitcher .
uh ... I can assure you , Mister Daggett ... the events described within are based ... on the accounts of eye witnesses and ...	meaning the duck himself , I guess .
"duck , I says . "" you have insulted the honor of this beautiful woman , Corcoran , "" said the duck . "" you must apologize . "" but Two Gun Corcoran would have none of it and , cursing , he reached for his pistols and would have killed them but The Duck was faster and hot lead blazed from his smoking sixguns . """	I believe that to be an accurate description of the events , sir ... albeit there is a certain poetry to the language which ...
well , Mister Beauchamp , I was at the Blue bottle saloon in Wichita the night English Bob killed Corky Corcoran ... an' I didn't see you there ... nor no woman , nor no twogun shooters nor nothin' like that .	you were there ?
first off ... Corky didn't carry two pistols , though he should of .	but he was called ...
and ?	bam ! that Walker Colt blew up in his hand ... which was a failing common to that model . now if Corky would have really had two guns instead of just a big dick he could have defended himself to the end .
you ... you mean ... English Bob killed him while ... ?	well he wasn't gonna wait for Corky to grow no new hand . he walked over real close , bein' drunk , an' shot him through the liver .
but if the other fellow is quicker and fires first ...	he will be hurryin' and he will miss . that there is as fast as I can pull an' aim an' hit anythin' more'n ten feet away ... unless it's a barn .
but ... if he doesn't miss ?	then he will kill you . that is why there are so few dangerous men like old Bob there ... an' like me . it ain't so easy to shoot a man anyhow ... an' if the sonofabitch is shootin' back at you ... well , it'll unnerve most fellas . look here , let me show you somethin' . see this here pistol ?
them's the keys . all you gotta do is shoot me an' you an' English Bob can ride out free as birds .	is ... is it ... loaded ?
R-r-r-really ? you r-r-really w- wwant ... ?	give it to him .
""" well , Jim , "" I says , "" it makes me sick to see a man struttin' around and packin' two pistols an' a Henry rifle and cryin' like a baby . """	did you ... kill him ?
uh ... Sheriff ... Uh ...	huh ? oh . another one , huh ? shit , I guess I'm clean out of receptacles .
maybe you should ... hang the carpenter .	what ?
uh , no . no , I ain't drunk .	ordinance says you got to turn in your firearms to the County office day or night . I guess you didn't read it with the weather an' all .
well ... uh ... I ... I ain't got no , uh , firearms .	them friends of yours in the back , they carryin' pistols ?
I ... dunno . I mean , I guess not . no , they ain't carryin' no guns .	you're spillin' your whiskey , mister .
like I said , I ...	what's your name ?
uh , William ... uh ... Hendershot .	well , Mister Hendershot , if I was to call you a no good sonofabitch an' a liar , an' if I was to say you shit in your pants on account of a cowardly soul ... well , I guess then , you would show me your pistol right quick an' shoot me dead , ain't that so ?
I ... I guess I might ... but like I said , I ain't armed .	I guess you just carry it for snakes an' such .
uh ... yeah . yeah .	there ain't no snakes in here , Mister Hendershot .
he should have armed himself if he was gonna decorate his saloon with the body of my friend .	I guess you are Three-Fingered Jack out of Missouri , killer of women and children .

damaged property . like if I was to hamstring one of their cow ponies .	you figure nobody'll want to fuck her .
she could maybe clean up around the place or somethin' , but nobody's gonna pay good money for a cut-up whore .	you boys are off of the Spade outfit . got your own string of ponies ?
hit your finger , huh ?	huh ? Hullo , skinny . snuck up on me . how do you like her ?

Hullo , Bob . boys , this here is English Bob .	shit and fried eggs .

well , I was always tasting the soup two hours after I et it .	what I heard was that you fell off your horse drunk and broke your neck .
I heard that one myself , Bob . hell , I even thought I was dead til I found out it was just I was in Nebraska . who's your friend ?	"WW Beauchamp ... Little Bill Daggett and ... "" friends . """
books . he's my biographer .	oh .
not really ... Maybe a couple of Peacemakers ... I imagine you could overlook those , eh , Bill ? if you didn't see them ... or hear them ?	I guess not , Bob . I don't like guns around .
"Charley , see what kind of "" books "" Mister Beauchamp is packing ... but watch you don't get wet ."	be careful with those , sonny .
you leave me at the mercy of my enemies .	enemies , Bob ? you been talking about the Queen again ? on Independence Day ?
I thought ... you was an angel .	you ain't dead .
you don't look nothin' like me , mister .	I didn't mean no offense . I guess you're the one them cowboys cut up . Ned an' The Kid , my partners , are they ... ?
they went out scouting when they saw your fever broke .	scouting ?

them other two , they been takin' advances on the payment .	advances ?
free ones ?	Alice an' Silky gave them ... free ones .

I didn't mean ... with me . Alice and Silky , they'll give you one ... if you want .	I ... I guess not . I didn't mean I didn't want one' cause of you bein' cut up . I didn't mean that .
you're a beautiful woman an' ... if I was to want a free one , I guess I'd want you more than them others . it ain't ... See ... I can't have no free one on account of my wife ...	your wife ?
yeah . see ?	I admire that , you being true to your wife . I've seen a lot of ... of men ... who weren't .
she back in Kansas ?	uh ... yeah . yeah . she's uh ... watchin' over the little ones .
... wouldn't let you settle it , huh ?	"hell , you know how skinny is . says he's gonna shoot' em ... an I says , "" skinny , you can't do that , "" an' he says , "" Well , then get Little Bill down here an' let's settle this "" an' I says , "" Bill's sleepin' , skinny , "" an' ..."
he tell you where them others is ?	Nope .
didn't give us nothin' but his own name ... Ned Roundtree .	well , Ned , you'll want to tell me an' Mister Beauchamp here all about them two villainous friends of yours , I guess . bring him in , boys , for I will be glad to know the names and the whereabouts of those other two murdering sonsofbitches .
where's Little Bill for Christ sake ?	ha . he was building his fucking porch .
he's coming ain't he ?	&apos; course he's coming .
what'd he say ?	little Bill ? he didn't say nothing . like I said , he was Buildin' his porch . have you seen that thing ?
asked what they looked like , that's all . Christ , maybe he's tough but he sure ain't no carpenter .	maybe he ain't so tough .
we never seen him up against any ... like these ones ... killers .	little Bill come out of Kansas an' Texas , boys . he worked them tough towns .
I wouldn't point no pistol at nobody , sir .	a wise policy . but if you did , I can assure you , the sight of royalty would cause you to dismiss all thoughts of bloodshed and stand ... in awe . whereas , a president ... I mean , why not shoot a president ?
now this Strawberry Alice person , tell me again .	down the street and across . Greely's Beer Garden and Billiard parlor . just ask for Alice and say you want a game of billiards .
billiards , eh ? even though I don't really wish to play ?	don't matter . they burned the table in' 78 for firewood .
ah , I see .	I didn't think they'd really do it .
what did you think , they come clear up from Kansas to fuck us ?	that Kid ... he's just a ... boy . and that other one , Bill , being true to his wife ...
what wife ? he don't have no wife .	he said ...
where'd you get the money , huh ?	we ain't got it . we ain't got no money .
you told them cowboys you had it .	we was ... lyin' .
what you gonna do when somebody comes to collect ? fuck' EM ? fuck' EM A thousand TIMES ? the kind of people who'll come after that thousand , they won't tolerate if you don't have it . they won't just cut your face up a little . stupid cunts !	rain's coming .
she's gonna live . she didn't steal nothin' , She didn't touch his poke .	no ?
a whippin' ? that's all they get ? after what they done ?	whippin' ain't a little thing , Alice .
I fined' em instead .	for what they done ? skinny gets some ponies an' that's ... ?
ain't you seen enough blood for one night ? hell , Alice , they ain't loafers nor tramps nor bad men . they're hard workin' boys that was foolish . why if they was given over to wickedness in a regular way ...	like whores ?
if they was just here for the fuckin' , how come they lit out the back window ?	on account of they seen you was beatin' on their friend .
you just kicked the shit out of a innocent man , you big asshole .	innocent of what ?
no more sitting in this room . I've let it go on long enough .	I'm not going out anymore . I'm not getting hurt again . this was the last time . I told you .
... I got a present for you .	why ?
well , go get it then .	where is it ?
we're going to prevent any substantial atrophy of your good leg with this . it works the quadriceps .	how long have you been married ?
twelve years .	how did you get together ?
now you're going to have to tell me more .	... See my husband was a big football star in college and we were in an accident together . our car flipped on an icy road . we were both injured . he couldn't play football anymore . if that hadn't happened , we wouldn't have been together .
how so ?	football wasn't the kind of life I wanted ... For ten years I'd be by the phone waiting for a call telling me he broke his neck in a practice game . and if it wasn't that call , it would be a call telling me he blew out his knee or suffered his third concussion . I've seen way too much of it in my job ... I can barely take it when my clients are in pain . I don't hate the game . I admire the amount of skill it involved and , like everyone else , I was in awe of how he could play it , but I couldn't give him my heart and then have something happen to him . and it always does with that game . it's not a thing many people would understand .
any way , fate stepped in and took football out of the equation .	... And everyone lived happily ever after .
is this a religious thing ?	I own a comic book museum . it's called the Limited edition .
for a second there I thought you were a fanatic .	I believe comic books are based loosely on reality -- I believe there are real life equivalents of the heroes in those books that walk the earth -- I believe your husband is one of those individuals .
how are you feeling ?	okay .
you are in the emergency room of the University of Pennsylvania Hospital . you were in a serious accident . how's your vision ?	fine .
where were you sitting on the train ?	against a window .
yes . where are the rest of the passengers ?	was your family traveling with you ?
no .	did you get up from your seat ?
it's my field . I represent athletes . I'm an agent .	what a coincidence ? I'm a male synchronized swimmer and I'm looking for representation .
is that right ?	but I'm afraid of water , so that's been holding my career back a little bit .
you represent someone in Philadelphia ?	I'm meeting a player from Temple University . he's a cornerback . you like football ?
not really .	this kid is six foot two , two hundred and forty pounds . he runs the fifty in under six seconds . he's going to be a God .
yeah , hello .	is David Dunne there ?
he doesn't look very threatening .	that's what I said to my son . he said , there's always two kinds . the soldier villain who fights the hero with his hands , and then there's the real threat . the brilliant and evil arch enemy who fights the hero with his mind .
Jeremy , why don't you go sleep with your mom ?	I want to sleep here tonight .
I think it's be better if I was alone .	I won't make any noise .
he going pro in the draft . they say he can run the fifty--	in under six seconds . I've heard .
I'm going to go in .	just play one set of downs . I told them you were great .
why'd you do that ?	just one--
Jeremy . I'm going in . I have to do some things .	what things ?
I'm going to work out .	I'll help you .
you think you could beat up Mike Tyson ? I mean before he started wiggin out and eating people's ears ?	no .
no .	what if you only ate foods that were good for you and you worked out everyday for a year ?
you put too much . that's two hundred and fifty pounds .	how much can you lift ?
I mean if you knew Karate ?	no Jeremy .
how much did you take off ?	I lied .
how much is it ?	two hundred and seventy .
what do you do if something happens ?	get mom .
how many did you put on that time ?	all of it .
there's no more left ?	I'm sleeping in my room .
I'm not scared .	that's great .
know what ?	you're secret identity . that man was right .
you won'T GET HURT ...	Elijah was wrong .
that was me they were talking about . I almost died . that was me .	you're lying .
I'll just shoot him once .	Jeremy listen to what--
don't be scared .	Jeremy if you pull that trigger I'm going to leave ! I'm going to go to New York .
Dunne , it's Jenkins , we got a guy at gate 17C with a bogus ticket . says he knows you . he won't tell me his name .	what's he look like ?
he's got the most beautiful eyes ... The hell kind of question is that ? he's a guy .	send him packing . I'm not walking all the way over there .
yeah ?	there's a message for you at the office . your kid was hurt .
when ?	just now . they want you to come down to his school .
I am . I'm helping him with the sale .	it's a pleasure to meet you . I'm David Dunne .
he's spoken of you . he says you're becoming friends .	we are .
he's doing well today .	I'm very proud of him . he's been through a lot in his life . a lot of ups and downs , a lot of bad spells . a couple I'd thought had broken him ... I mean emotionally . they were bad ... But he made it . yes he did .
he's kind of a miracle .	yes he is .
you've never been sick ?	I don't know for sure . ... I don't think so .
how certain are you that you haven't been sick in your life ?	seventy-five percent .
seventy-five percent ? that's not nearly good enough for me . I'm extremely skeptical .	skeptical about what ?
what's he talking about ?	in college . a car accident .
I assumed because of the train .	you assumed wrong .
"you forgot the "" Now I'm going to tell you what the hell is going on "" step . see usually that comes before the , "" It's over "" Step . and it always , always comes before the "" You can go "" Step . what is over ?"	the life of an idea that has lived too long in my head .
this city has had its share of disasters . well publicized ones . it was around the time of that plane crash , when it first entered my head . and there it stayed , as I waited and watched the news over the years ... And then one day I see a news report on a train accident and its sole survivor who was miraculously unharmed . and just like that , an idea blossoms into the flower of possible reality .	what was your idea Elijah ?
at the church ... You were following me weren't you ?	technically no . I gambled that you would attend the church service . I just waited for you .
what's this about ? this is obviously some scam . is this where you tell me one of those pictures is like an investment ?	you've misunderstood .
it's for last week's game .	I've come to understand that ... An ill advised purchase in the parking lot .
what do you want ?	not money . but I appreciate your healthy cynicism in the manner . it will be wise for both of us to proceed with greatest caution .
we're not proceeding anywhere together .	we've already begun .
why is it , do you think , that of all the professions in the world ... you chose protection ?	are you for real ?
just give me a minute .	is there a problem ?
I got you a seat in the seven hundred level . it's nose-bleed territory , but at least you won't get spit on .	how did you know that man you bumped was carrying a weapon ?
probably the army jacket . those guys carry hunting knives and stuff for show .	you thought he was carrying a knife ?
I thought he was carrying something .	but not a knife ?
I got this picture of a silver handled gun tucked in his pants . like on t.v.	you have good instincts when it comes to things like that ?
like what ?	telling when people have done something wrong ?
yes .	have you ever tried to develop it ?
I don't know what you're asking ?	you're skill .
listen . I got to be on the sidelines during the game ... You can get to your seat by taking the stairwell at--	characters in comic books are often attributed special powers . x-ray vision , things of that sort .
okay , I don't want to play this game anymore .	it's an exaggeration of the truth . maybe it's based on something as simple as instinct . like being able to touch someone and tell whether they've done something wrong ... Or the level of what they've done wrong .
the guy might not have been carrying anything .	or he might have been carrying a silver handled gun tucked in his pants .
I have to go now .	one last question .
quick .	the car accident you were in ... Was there anyone else involved ?
I must have felt some lump in his back when I bumped him . most guns have a black or silver handle . I had a fifty-fifty shot at the color .	that's not what I witnessed David .
stop messing with my life Elijah . my son almost shot me last night . he wanted to prove you were right .	I never said you couldn't be killed . I never said that .
you have a problem , Elijah . my wife is right . somewhere along the line one of your bones broke and your mind just broke with it .	are you finished ?
I'm still going to New York . just not this second .	I don't want to drag this out too long for Jeremy .
is Jeremy okay ?	he's asleep .
I don't know . it's been a while .	I haven't been sick this year . I know that .
okay .	do you remember me getting sick ?
not a specific day . what's this about ?	Megan , do you ever remember me getting sick ?
... I can't remember .	that's strange isn't it ? not remembering one fever ... Or a cold ... Or a sore throat . what do you think that means ?
is that what you wanted to ask me ?	yes .
is there anything else you wanted to ask me while I'm up ? ... When was the last time you wore pink ? when was the last time you drank soup standing up ? final call for strange questions at two in the morning .	no that's it .
when was the last time I wore pink ?	the Mitchell barbecue three years ago .
oh shit ...	matching shirt and shorts . it was brutal .
I've come to a decision .	oh .
Megan ?	yes . is this David ?
yeah ? Megan where are you calling from ?	my name is Megan Inverso . we went to college together .
... When you work with clients on machines , do they sometimes just jump up a level or two ? do something they didn't know they were capable of ?	not often , but it is possible . most people get scared when they see the shadow of their limits . they don't know how long the shadow really is . they don't know how far away the real limits are standing ... They stop out of fear .
what do I do when I'm around someone I know ?	you use your sleeve .
he's just laying in bed . he's pretty upset . he won't talk .	he's dealing with a lot of things . I think he needs to find answers himself .
would you like to try going--	yes .
oh . Elijah Price came to visit me at the center today .	Jesus .
... I think rust .	rust ?
as a color , not as rust . you know , a rust colored paint or wood ?	I didn't know that . mine's still brown .
soft and wet , by the artist formerly known as Prince .	what was that ?
we're supposed to be honest .	soft and wet . that's very interesting .
I'm not sure .	think carefully ?
I had a nightmare one night and I didn't wake you up so you could tell me it was okay . I think that was the first time . does that count ?	that counts .
why ?	I don't know Megan .
wrap it up .	you've made a considerably wise decision .
once again please ?	my son Jeb . it's a gift for him .
how old is Jeb ?	four .
I'm listening .	I'll keep it in my office room .
what about Jeb ?	I have a lock on the door .
yes ?	is Noel in ?
no sir he is not . I read about you in the paper .	oh .
wow .	I had to put him down .
proceed .	ask if he can check how many sick days I've taken since I've worked here ?
is that the entire message ?	yes .
where's the fire sweetheart ? don't know how they work things in Nevada , but we got speed limits in this state .	Vat ? I am going 5 miles an hour ! I am looking town . I not even moving .
whoa , what kind of accent you got there ? you one of them Russians ?	I am Russian , da ! I am also &lt; u &gt; rich &lt; / u &gt; Russian , da ? maybe we work something out , my friend Sheriff ?
"what's that ? ... "" concealed "" is a definite no no in this town , Ivan . you know anything about Jamilla's grocery store ?"	what fuckin grocery store , you fucking shithead idiot ! you call yourself a police ...
get out of the car , spread them . you can jawbone all you want or you have the right to &lt; u &gt; shut the fuck up &lt; / u &gt; ! you commie motherfucker . either way you're goin' to the can .	I want my lawyer !
I axed you a question .	aw , Toby , we weren't doing nothing . we was just talking .
honest , Toby . I just axed him for a quarter for the jukebox .	stay out of this , Jenny . we got man's business to take care of . I ain't never taken no drugs , mister , and ...
I want to stay .	I said come on !
who was that on the phone ?	wrong number .
you spent a long time talking for a wrong number . but then you make friends so easily . don't you , Grace ?	I put up new drapes , Jake .
I know . I was here when your apprentice was helping you . remember ?	you never said anything . about the drapes .
they look nice .	you haven't even looked at them once .
they look nice .	I picked them out for you , Jake . I thought you would like the colors .
what the hell you looking at , girl ?	nothing , Jake . absolutely nothing .
ya little bitch , you like it don't you ! you like it this way -- rough and hard . gotta go fuck around on me , like your Mama , but you always gotta come home to Daddy , don't you , cause you know Daddy's the best .	yes , yes , hit me ... beat me , please .
oh no ! oh please forgive me , Papa !	you broke her heart ! you broke your Mama's heart . you stole me ! that's right . fuck it away . but it ain't ever goin' away , cause your Mama -- she's like a hungry ghost baby , she won't go away , she won't leave ya alone .
what's the matter ?	you didn't hear something ?
yeah , I heard a key slapping against my ass .	there's someone in the house .
Jake , don't go out there . call the sheriff .	shhhh ! just like your Mama , always scared of things ...
help me , Grace , help ...	like you helped her , Jake ?
morning Grace .	morning Sheriff . got my drapes .
well it's about time . looks like you found yourself a helper too .	well , he offered , and I just couldn't refuse . his car overheated .
anybody hurt ?	hell , no . that Wayne can't shoot when he's sober , much less drunk . he's lucky he didn't kill his own danged self . well , anyhow , you stay cool . nice meeting you , son .
you fuck this guy -- get him to do your dirty work and you think you can take the money and dump me ?	no baby , you got it wrong .
I don't want the fuckin' money ! I'm not gonna give up everything I got for a lousy 50,000 dollars . it's &lt; u &gt; you &lt; / u &gt; . you &lt; u &gt; Grace &lt; / u &gt; or nothing . the whole thing ... I want you to be my wife .... What do you way Grace ?	you sound just like Jake ... I did see into the future , Virgil , but you weren't in it . go back to your family . they love you .
goddamnit Virgil , stop ! don't !	... But I bet the story she &lt; u &gt; didn't &lt; / u &gt; tell you was the best story of all . how old crazy Jake &lt; u &gt; was really her Papa &lt; / u &gt; . and she &lt; u &gt; liked &lt; / u &gt; fucking Papa ! and now she's killed the sonufabitch ! just like she's gonna kill you !
my lord , that little baby of yours Virgil , has gotten cuter'n a bunny's nose .	what was that all about ?
