So near we can almost touch it ? or wait a little while longer , when I can give myself without hesitation ? ... When I can be totally and unashamedly yours ? ?",51

you have the wrong house .,6,and who might you be ?,6
Dr. Frederick Fronkonsteen .,4,the grandson of Victor' Fronkonsteen' ?,6
no !,2,what was your grandfather's name ?,6
Victor Frankenstein .,3,"forgive me for intruding so late at night , Herr Baron . but an ugly rumor has it that there are strange goings on in this castle . these good citizens are ready to rip you from limb to limb unless you can offer some rational explanation for their fears . how say you ?",55
"ugly , vicious rumous .",5,"they say , also , that you have recreated the horrible monster who , for so many years , has haunted and terrorized the God-fearing people of this village . what say you to that ?",36
I think we all need a good night's sleep . why don't we meet next week and thrash this thing out ?,22,now wait a minute !,5
"yes , my dear , he is .",8,and has he achieved ... any special degree of eminence ?,11
he is the fifth leading authority in his field .,10,"oh , shit .",4
"I'll never understand your regard for them , Charles .",10,and I'll never understand terrorists .,6
"I am trying to save our kind , Charles . you should do the same .",16,"not at the cost of lives , Max .",9
is that so ?,4,still trying to make the world safe for our kind . still trying to find a way to introduce ourselves -- definitively .,23
"you definition of definitive was always a bit extreme for me , Max . what is it like these days ?",21,"let's just say that I am out to make some radical changes . now come on Charles . for old times sake , for your sake ... Leave him to me .",32
if I could make you understand . if you could just be made to see it the way I do . the way it's going to be .,28,the way what is going to be ?,8
"I'm going to change the world with or without you as a witness , Charles . and this one gets a front row seat .",25,what do you mean to do ?,7
this checkmate goes to you . I didn't want to hurt anyone . but you leave me no choice .,20,what DO YOU MEAN TO DO ?,7
"I wouldn't really have let you die , you know . I just needed ...",15,I know .,3
"doesn't it ever wake you in the middle of the night ? the feeling that some day , some day very soon , they will pass that foolish law - or one just like it - and they will come for you and your children ? take you all away ?",51,"it does indeed , Max .",6
and what do you do when you wake up to that ?,12,I feel a great swell of pity for the poor soul who comes to that school again looking for trouble .,21
I lost him .,4,how ?,2
is that what you're looking for ?,7,a piece . only a piece .,7
is it enough ?,4,enough for a test .,5
I'll find him .,4,alive .,2
why is everybody up at sunrise ?,7,"the sun is setting , Logan . you've been asleep for nineteen hours .",14
what did she do to me ?,7,"she borrowed your power to save her life . when she touches someone , she absorbs their strengths -- their gifts . in your case -- your ability to heal . that's why she keeps her body covered .",39
I felt like she almost killed me .,8,if she held on any longer she could have .,10
what am I doing here ?,6,I brought you here so that you would be safe from magneto .,13
who ?,2,"a very powerful mutant who for some reason has taken an interest in you . I'm not sure why , but until we find out , I must ask you to stay .",33
"forty-eight hours , old man . but if you cross me , I won't feel any guilt about what I do to you .",24,deal .,2
the point of what ?,5,"this . this whole God damn thing . making yourselves into some sort of "" team "" of super-powered freaks . teaching wayward mutants about classical literature . for what ?",31
the point is to step into a more evolved position of social responsibility . to recognize that there is a world out there and that we mutants are as much a part of it as normal human beings .,39,what if it never happens ? what if they're so afraid of us that we become the enemy ? -- This place is gonna be one giant cemetery .,29
now that's magneto talking .,5,no . that's me talking . and you know what ? it's only been thirty-two hours and you still have no idea what this guy wants with me .,29
where are we going ?,5,to find Rogue .,4
how ?,2,the brainwaves of mutants are quite different than those of the average human being .,15
you designed this yourself ?,5,"actually , magneto helped me put it together .",9
he helped you ?,4,we were friends once ... But that was a long time ago .,13
they're all asking how you're doing . are you feeling up to saying hello to everyone ?,17,actually I'm feeling up to leaving .,7
"why ? you have a home here now , if you want it . everyone will ...",17,"what ? ... miss me ? Charley , I'm gonna walk out the front door and trust me , it won't be soon enough for everyone here .",28
I do love a good check mate .,8,what do you want ?,5
come with me and I'll let her live .,9,you think I care about her ? I'm the only one who's sure to walk out of here .,19
where am I ?,4,you're backstage at the encore of creation .,8
you ... wha ... Who are you ... Where is Henry ?,12,Mr. Guyrich has been dead for some time Senator .,10
the intention of registration act -,6,"intention ? intention , Senator ? we are talking about mankind here . his fear . it is only a matter of time before mutants will be herded into camps . studied for weaknesses . and eventually wiped off the face of the Earth .",45
what is it you intend to do to me ?,10,"let's just say , God works too slowly .",9
"you're avoiding the question I posed to you at the beginning of the hearing , Ms. Grey . three words : are mutants dangerous ?",25,"I am avoiding a question that is decidedly loaded , Senator . the wrong person behind the wheel of a car can be dangerous .",25
"Ms. Grey -- you work at a school for mutants in Westchester , New York . can you tell the members of this committee what exactly you are teaching these mutants ?",32,math . history . science . English . Athletics --,10
you wouldn't happen to be teaching them how to use their powers to --,14,"control , Senator ... we teach them control .",9
"this was taken by a state police officer in Secaucus , New Jersey . a man in a minor altercation literally melted the car in front of him . I don't know where you come from , Ms. Grey , but where I come from , you don't go melting people's cars when they cut you off . you do it the old fashioned way -- you give' em the finger . but what you presume to tell this committee -",81,"I presume nothing , I am here to tell you that in time , the mutator gene will activate in every living human being on this planet . perhaps even your children , Senator .",35
"I'm sorry to come here , Ms. Grey . I was afraid if I went to a hospital , they would ...",22,treat you like a mutant ? we are not what you think . not all of us .,18
tell it to the ones that did this to me .,11,the mutant gene tells the body when it needs to change .,12
some cigars . case of beer .,7,there's no smoking or drinking on the school grounds .,10
I won't light the cigars - how about that ?,10,"I'll see what I can do -- You should get some sleep . even with your healing ability , you're going to be hurting for a while .",28
what if I like the pain ?,7,"the Professor said you were a solider . actually , I believe he used the word mercenary .",18
yeah ? well I don't like to talk about my past .,12,"maybe , the Professor could help you with that .",10
by reading my thoughts ?,5,if necessary .,3
you should always work with a spotter .,8,he's busy right now .,5
were you now ?,4,what do you say ?,5
he takes his work seriously .,6,he takes himself seriously .,5
"Logan , do you see this ring ?",8,I've seen a lot of rings .,7
inspiring -- Now what am I doing here ?,9,I wanted to talk to you .,7
how long have you been in Alaska ?,8,I don't remember . is that what you wanted to ask me ?,13
I've served with men like you before . methodical . Systematic -- naive . you know what happens to those men in a real fight ?,26,"you know , you --",5
I'm o.k. I'm o.k.,4,"sure you are , sport .",6
Scott .. I -,4,I don't like him being here .,7
what are you talking about ?,6,"you saw what happened tonight . you think magneto won't come after him again . you think he won't come here if necessary . this is a school , for God's sake .",33
what's wrong with him ?,5,his vital signs are weak and getting weaker .,9
"he's already losing control of his vitals . respiratory . cardiovascular . unless we manage to replace the filter by tomorrow morning , I'm afraid .",26,we have to find magneto .,6
are you all right ?,5,no . I'm ... I don't know if we can do this without Charles .,15
hey . I'm sorry . about Logan . I was jealous .,12,"well , I think that's perfectly understandable .",8
I'll tell you one thing though .,7,what's that ?,3
"radar Stealth mode checks out . all right , there'll be less security north of the George Washington Bridge . I'm taking her down .",25,into the Hudson ?,4
"I'm going to assume that means that the Secret Service is out of commission . Jean , can you raise me up there ?",24,it's too far .,4
I'm sorry . I'm not strong enough .,8,can the Professor repair his own mind ?,8
"correct ... Apparently , Adamantium is the only metal strong enough to hold the energy this machine produces . he used the Adamantium in Logan's dog tag to test it on the Senator . and I assume now he plans to use the rest of Logan's skeleton for a larger demonstration .",52,for what purpose ?,4
yes -- Only there's a problem . the mutator gene is not responding to the radiation the way it would in mother nature . it's forcing the body's cells to replicate thousands of times faster than they're accustomed to . the Senator's body is literally burning itself out . Scott -- this machine kills people and I don't think magneto realizes it .,63,so where do you think he's planning this larger demonstration ?,11
what does that mean ?,5,"the neuro-filter acts like a surge Protector , regulating the infinite flow of information from Cerebro to the Professor's mind . it's what keeps him from being crushed by the consciousness of millions .",34
Thomas Edison knew how to make the light bulb . he had the energy source . he had the vacuum . but he didn't have the filament . he tried metal after metal but nothing would hold to power .,40,... until he found tungsten .,6
I wish I could go .,6,we all do .,4
"storm . try to look for the highest vantage point . from what I can figure , he'll need to gain as much altitude as possible to blanket the island . it is my feeling that magneto has to--",39,beast .,2
that's the guy .,4,this pizda ? never seen him before .,8
cops . like a plague . no matter how many you pay there's always another with his hand out . how did you pick him out ?,27,he flashed his badge to half the bar when he bought his drink .,14
"I appreciate you bringing this to our attention . whatever you want , the rest of the night , consider it on the house .",25,"thanks , but I'm here on business . I heard you're the G around here . I'm looking for some cars , expensive ones . a lot of them .",30
"sorry , man , don't know what you're talking about .",11,"I'm talking about the sports cars that disappear off the docks in Genoa and wind up here . if you don't know about' em , who does ?",28
I remember that one where you jump the motorcycle over the freeway at rush hour .,16,when else are you gonna do it ?,8
I'm somewhat less so . we seem to have a bit of a problem ...,15,I had to inspect the merchandise first .,8
of course .,3,what's this ?,3
"what's going on , my friend ?",7,you tell me ! you got a sniper up there or what ?,13
"he's not with us , Xander . he must be with you .",13,bullshit ! you get your boy off that roof or I swear to God I'm gonna give you another hole to breathe out of .,25
"total chaos , man ! welcome to anarchy 99 !",10,"what's "" anarchy 99 "" ?",6
"it's all this craziness ! it's what we've been living since 99 , when we left the Army . one of our brothers died in Grozny and we said the hell with this shit . what for ? he dies for what ? politics ? who's politics ? not ours .",51,you wanna see my politics ?,6
"screw the world . if I'm gonna die for something , it better be bitches and money .",18,"that's what I'm talking about , man ! that's why anarchy 99 was born .",15
""" ... try walking into a deli and urinating on the cheese "" .' anarchy Burger' by the Vandals .",20,"you got it , man . it's stupid but it's true . true freedom is when you do whatever you want anytime you want . that's when you know you're living , man .",34
how you gonna do that with government and rules everywhere ?,11,easy . you get enough money that you grow an ass big enough for the whole world to kiss .,20
you got a great set-up here Yorgi . you really know how to live .,15,"it's a beautiful town , Prague . it's been good to me .",13
"I've been here before , when I was a kid . my old man was in the service , we used to live on the Army base in Hamburg .",30,"you , an Army brat ? I don't see that one at all . did you join the service as well ?",22
"hell no . my dad was a straight up tin soldier . somehow he pissed this general off and got himself dishonorably discharged . had a court martial and everything . the charges were total bullshit , so he was sure he'd get his name cleared , but it didn't happen .",52,"connections and politics , it's the same everywhere .",9
"I've got meetings this afternoon , I've got to get some sleep . just pick a girl .",18,"that's alright , I'm kinda tired .",7
"and you . why do you have such a problem staying away , my friend ? did you miss us that much ?",23,I wanted to get the hell out of Prague before silent Night falls .,14
"what's the gimmick , Yorgi ? that's the part I don't get . you gonna hold the world hostage with your gas bombs ? I didn't think you were dumb enough to go with that hack cliche .",38,"you think I'm after money ? I told you , my friend . anarchy . time for a change . money is good , but for true freedom you have to get rid of the rules themselves .",38
"so all by yourself , you're going to destroy every government ; in the world .",16,"easier than that , buddy . I'll get them to destroy each other . you kill an entire Peace conference , someone is going to have to pay . then our friend Ahab continues down the river to the ocean and begins his world tour . London , Cairo , Beijing ... Pretty soon everyone's involved . these guys bomb those guys , those guys invade these guys . soon the whole world is like your wild West cowboy days . no rules , no law , everybody free to do what they want .",95
"including rape , pillage , murder .",7,"sure , if that's what you want . why not ? it's all human nature . so we just have to launch our baby and wait for the decline and fall of civilization as we know it .",38
"and here I thought "" anarchy "" was just something cool to put on a Tshirt .",17,"come on , Xander . you used to stand for something . what happened to you , man ? I thought you'd get it .",25
"you both could have been a part of it . you could have ridden with us into a new day , the dawning of a new age of --",29,oh just shoot us already . I'm sorry I asked .,11
what's so damn funny ?,5,been to any good diners lately ?,7
who's writing this dude's dialogue ?,6,"he's a pretty good actor , though .",8
help me with this guy .,6,"it's like you said , every man for himself .",10
they're all over the place ! what the hell's going on ?,12,looks like we're in the middle of the drug war .,11
sit down .,3,"I've been on a plane for twelve hours , I think I'll stand .",14
"my name is Slovo , Czech secret police . when you are here you are under my jurisdiction , you take my orders , you do what I say . if you become any kind of an inconvenience , I'll shoot you .",43,here we go again .,5
nice hops .,3,the corner . anarchy 99 .,6
"Dude , what are you doing here ?",8,"you killed me , remember ? now I have to hide out here with you . where have you been ?",21
I found something big enough for us to take these guys down with . they've got a of nerve agent they're gonna unleash .,24,is this what you're looking for ?,7
"sorry , "" dude "" .",6,what's the deal ?,4
why you dogging me up ?,6,they came and found me . they said they'd kill me unless I help them . plus they offer me a lot of money . no big deal . these things happen . dump your gun on the floor .,40
"hey , you don't need all this just to go on vacation . unless this ain't for going on vacation ...",21,"I'm through , Xander .",5
I can see that . why ?,7,"you run around with maniacs jumping motorcycles in the desert , you break 36 bones crashing wave runners and snowboarding off cliffs , all with no health insurance ... It's insane , I can't take it anymore .",38
"I'm having fun , what's the problem ?",8,"you have all this talent , and you waste it . you won't take a single endorsement deal . meanwhile those other guys have their own video games ! but no , you've got too much "" integrity "" for that .",42
French Polynesia ? this wouldn't last us a week in a cheap hotel . do you know how expensive it is down there ?,24,"alright , so I'll get more .",7
"it's not about the money , X ! you never plan for anything . I can't live like that anymore , I need some stability .",26,"well if you're bailing , I guess I'd better give you your surprise now .",15
what ... ?,3,"I was gonna wait till the islands , but ...",10
you're serious ?,3,"of course I'm serious . I bought it , didn't I ?",12
this is so typical . I can't believe you . I've barely seen you for the last three weeks and now this ? are you out of your mind ?,30,"I don't know . I thought this is what you wanted . you want stability , here it is .",20
"you can't just propose to me out of nowhere . you think that's going to solve our problems ? I'm sorry , X. It was a kick for a while , but it's over . you're just not going anywhere .",41,"you're not exactly "" going anywhere "" yourself .",9
hate those Russkie choppers . Rattle- trap pieces of garbage . I'm agent Shavers . Toby Lee Shavers . I'm looking for what's his name . three X' s .,30,that's would be me .,5
"back off , just go away you Klutz . alright , here's the story . the items in these cases belong to me . I designed them , built them , and was going to use them in the field myself until you showed up .",46,"I stole your beat , huh ? guess you forgot to brown-nose the right people .",16
"is that supposed to be funny ? I'm not laughing . I've worked for ten years to get my shot at being a field agent , funny boy . and ar the last minute I get bumped by you , some reject from the Ozzfest .",46,why don't you show me some gear before you get hurt .,12
"miniature power cams set in on contact , giving you a sure grip on any surface .",17,they come in any other styles or colors ?,9
this is your standard dart gun .,7,that one I'm real familiar with .,7
I think I'll hang on to these .,8,"think again , that's government property . you have to sign for everything . I've got one more that wasn't on your list .",24
from the Beastie Boys collection ?,6,"it's a stakeout suit . it's got food , water , recording gear , anything you need for covert spying . it's all- weather , fire retardant , and if you give this buckle a sharp pull , the whole outfit deploys into a parachute .",46
"you're joking , right ?",5,"now that I've given you the overview , we're going to spend the next couple hours going into extensive operational detail .",22
nothing . he had two days .,7,perhaps he is not all he says he is .,10
what are you doing ?,5,it all happened so fast . such an unfortunate accident .,11
what was that for ?,5,I'd forgotten how exciting it is working together .,9
"you've been so quiet lately , Petra , I thought you no longer cared .",15,why don't we go below decks and work off some of this adrenaline .,14
Viktor ! stay the course .,6,the Peace conference ...,4
ten is hardly worth the effort . we're talking a lousy million five U.S.,14,"I have Japanese buyers who are looking to move a fleet , if you have the quality of merchandise they're after . and it's a mil two , max .",30
do you know what a wire transfer is ?,9,"is she for real ? honey , maybe you should quiet down and let the grownups have a conversation .",20
"my goodness , a word with four syllables . I should get some ice before your brain gets too hot .",21,sure . just chisel some off your heart .,9
"if you got a problem with me , why are we dancing ?",13,Yorgi asked me to .,5
you do everything Yorgi says ?,6,go to hell .,4
"it's gonna be like that , huh ? you got all bent out of shape as soon as he started dancing with someone else . why's that ?",28,mind your business .,4
"why are you still hanging around ? your business is finished , you should go home .",17,I was invited . what's your story ?,8
"I don't know who you are or where you come from , but I don't like you . you ask too many questions .",24,"come on , don't front like that . you'll put a guy right off you .",16
"don't even bother , X man , I'm not your type .",12,that right ? why's that ?,6
who are you ?,4,"we hung out last night , remember ?",8
"I also remember you drove your car here . who are you really ? make no mistake , I will shoot you and not feel bad about it . who are you working for ?",35,"hey , take it easy . I'm just a dude trying to make a buck .",16
"bullshit . I see you look at everything , study everything , ask questions . I know exactly what you're doing . empty your pockets .",26,"you've got to relax , baby , you're paranoid .",10
"hey , you're good .",5,"maybe we should start again , yes ? I know so little about you , except that you're not what you say you are .",25
I don't know what you're talking about .,8,"the eyes don't lie . all this has gotten to you , hasn't it , Petra ? you came in as Yorgi's girlfriend and you stayed because it was fun . now you don't like it so much , but you're in so deep you can't get out anymore . tell me if I'm wrong , Petra .",58
go to hell !,4,look at you . you're helping run things now . you're a gangster . I bet that snuck up on you . you woke up one day and you were a criminal .,33
what are you ?,4,I'm an information gatherer . you wanna go somewhere and talk about it ?,14
that's how you eat ? it's like a gerbil .,10,I'm from L.A.,3
so why don't you tell me something about who you gather information for . they obviously have very deep pockets . are you from a rival clan ?,28,let's just say I'm freelancing and leave it at that .,11
whoever sent you knew what they were doing . you and Yorgi are practically twins . two nihilistic fashion victims who make a lot of noise but don't say much .,31,don't judge a comic book by it's cover .,9
"I know where he's coming from . the only thing I really don't get is why he dumped you . up until I found that out , I thought his judgment was pretty sound .",35,"don't even start . I'll be honest , I don't trust you . Bur lets pretend for a minute that what you say is true , that I want to leave . what can you do about it ?",39
"the people I know want facts , the kinds of things an insider would know . they're interested in putting anarchy 99 out of business .",26,all I have to do is risk my life providing you with these facts .,15
we could work together . then maybe we could both get the hell out of here . there's a beach in Bora Bora with my name on it .,29,a beach named X ? that I'd like to see .,11
they tell me you're an American agent .,8,what are you talking about ?,6
there's no more time for games . they made you . there's a sniper out front waiting to put a bullet in your eye . tell me if it's true .,31,"it's a long story , but yeah , more or less .",12
"Jesus Christ . you're going to have to go out the back . the data that you copied with your toy . tomorrow , at six o'clock . look it up . we're taking a trip . be there at six and you'll have plenty to tell your people .",50,"if I go out the back , he'll know you've warned me .",13
"that's alright , I'll figure something out .",8,"not an option . just get up slowly like everything's cool . Petra , trust me . you just hung yourself out to dry for me , I'm not gonna let you down .",34
I can't let this happen . I want you to go out the back . I'll make up some excuse .,21,"they'll kill you , you know they will . besides , there is no back door . keep smiling . ready ? now .",24
so what's the plan with this Ahab ? are they selling it or what ?,15,"no , something worse . he says it's a surprise , but I know him . this is his masterpiece .",21
we've got to find out what it is . can you handle that ?,14,there's something I didn't have time to tell you before .,11
what's that ?,3,I'm a agent as well . KGB . I've been undercover for over a year .,16
you're what ? what the hell have you been doing ?,11,"I don't know . eight months ago I stop hearing from my people . no explanation , just silence . so I stay and I wait like I was told . soon I'm in so far , they'd kill me if I left . now every day I get farther and farther away from what I was . I'm like you said , a criminal .",66
"I'm busted up for you , but Jesus , what the hell are you doing ? those people almost drowned on that boat and you didn't lift a finger .",30,"no , I guess I've been no help at all to you .",13
get your head back in the game . there are lives at stake here .,15,"of course . I'll do what I can . I have to go , before they notice .",18
when can I see you again ?,7,"you can't , it's too risky . I'm not much help anyway , remember ?",15
are you alright ?,4,what the hell are you doing ? you could've killed me !,12
I heard you talking . I could tell where you were in the room .,15,I don't know what's going on anymore . I thought I was square with that dude . now everybody's switching sides like it's the WWF .,26
what are you doing with the Ivans ?,8,"I know which cops are good and which are bad . come with me . come on , right now .",21
we're getting out of this place . we've done enough .,11,"wait a minute , whoa . we can't go now . what's Yorgi got planned with that nerve agent ?",20
"it doesn't matter anymore , forget it .",8,"of course it matters . hey , hold on !",10
"what do we owe our governments ? yours kidnapped you , mine abandoned me .",15,"Petra , this ain't about the people that sent us here , you know that .",16
"no , now it's about us . let's do something for us before we both get killed . don't you want to get to Bora Bora , Xander ?",29,we can't leave now . we have to do something .,11
they left . to a fortress in the mountains .,10,we'll have to go after them .,7
aren't you afraid ?,4,"a long time ago I learned how to put fear away in a little place in my head . maybe that's my problem . if you don't feel fear you can do some amazing things , but you can also screw your life up in ways you can't imagine .",50
"I must be healthy , then , because I'm scared to death . I guess I'd better get back to Yorgi .",22,you don't have to do that .,7
"yes , I do . you're right . I can't just let him go free . besides , I can help you from the inside .",26,aren't they gonna wonder were you've been ?,8
"I was supposed to wait for the cop to kill you and then kill the cop . they'll believe me . I've been lying for so long , one more time won't hurt .",34,"when this is over , we're just gonna take off , the two of us . take a vacation .",20
he's a regular humanitarian . and all this time I thought he was just a tool .,17,Yorgi and Kirill .,4
did you do your homework ?,6,"if they launch it , I know how to bring it back .",13
where'd the damn truck go ? !,7,"go to the water , it's that way !",9
Toadies right behind .,4,let me .,3
you okay ?,3,a piece of shrapnel hit me .,7
he's shut out the communication circuit !,7,you can't talk to it ?,6
"no , it's like a safety . we are going to have to access the manual controls .",18,a manual control on a moving torpedo . this day keeps getting better and better .,16
it's running three meters down . twenty knots .,9,"it has to surface to release the nerve agent , right ?",12
by then it's too late ! the only way to safely dispose of the nerve agent is in deep water ! the chemicals will break down and dissipate !,29,use your grenades ! maybe we can blow it up underwater !,12
I can't believe my mission is finally over . I don't even know what to do with myself .,19,you can't welch on me now . we had a deal .,12
what are you doing ?,5,it's about your next mission . you need to be debriefed .,12
what game is that ?,5,"slick graphics , huh ? see these dudes ? they're called "" anarchy 99 "" , they're the bad guy bosses .",22
do they have any special powers ? the bosses always have special powers .,14,you wanna check it out ? come here .,9
"next we got a Siberian redneck , Viktor . into snowmobiles and snowboarding . so naturally , he covers prostitution and the drug trade .",25,naturally .,2
this guy's kinda dorky lookin' .,6,"Kirill , the sniper . looks like a bookworm , but he had 72 confirmed kills in Chechnya , they called him the "" finger of God "" . assassination and weapons .",33
"Yorgi masterminded the take-over of three Red Mafiya clans . cops called it "" blood week "" . he combined all of their global enterprises into one huge crime syndicate : anarchy 99 .",34,""" anarchy "" 99 "" ?",6
what are you gonna do ? they're Euro- trash .,10,what weapons do you have ?,6
"just about anything I want , it looks like . this is gonna be tough , though . there's no way to save this game . I gotta get it right the first time through .",36,what do you get if you finish ?,8
"nothing , really . my guy is just doing it to stay alive .",14,oh . I bet by the end he gets something out of it .,14
like what ?,3,he gets to be the hero .,7
Whatchu doing here ?,4,"oh , I don't know . it was an accident .",11
"we're on to the game , ese . you got the fake blood splattered all over the walls , you got your torture tools ... It's all very cute . but come on , let's quit while you're ahead . I'm only trying to save you a beatin' .",49,you saving me ? you talking pretty tough for a guy got himself chained to the ceiling .,18
"alright . you wanna eat through a tube , be my guest .",13,"now you're gonna make me enjoy this , funny guy . now I'm gonna take the whole foot off . Whatchu think of that ?",25
what do you have ?,5,"not a whole helluva lot . his final transmission was mangled . about something or someone called "" Ahab "" . whatever it is , it cost him his life .",31
he was the best there was . that makes three agents lost .,13,they're ruthless and they have a lot of firepower . it's only a matter of time before they figure out how to deploy silent Night . then we're gonna have a catastrophe on our hands .,36
silent Night in the hands of a bunch of impertinent cowboys,11,"we're gonna have to step in , Sam . those CIA boys couldn't find a clown in a field of cactus . let me take care of it .",29
how will you fix it ?,6,"I'll go in with a team . but first I'm going to need some intel . I'll have to put someone inside , someone new , someone they won't see coming . one of their own .",37
so you'll dredge the bottom again . you've done that before . the results were ... uneven .,18,"you wanna find out about rats , ask a rat . I've had my people put together a talent pool . I downloaded it to your desktop .",28
"the usual prospects . convicts , contract killers , murde ...",11,the scum of the Earth .,6
but programmable . and expendable .,6,I've seen enough . turn it off .,8
they're degenerates . there's not a man in there that would give a damn if the Chinese took over .,20,that's exactly why we need them .,7
"ridiculous . cut him off . I'm sorry Gibbons , you pulled up a shark this time .",18,I think we should send him whatever he wants .,10
you what ? a wire transfer of this size ?,10,"if it means getting silent Night back , absolutely .",10
you're talking about a very expensive risk here .,9,"he's gotten closer in 24 hours than all of the other operatives combined . he got us an account number to boot . now even if he's just dumb and lucky , I say we back his play . I put him out there , Sam . if he doesn't come up with the money , they'll kill him . I can't let that happen .",66
the name's Gibbons . you were saying ?,8,what is this place ?,5
looks like a diner .,5,"diner , huh ? let me tell you what the problem is . I wake up drugged to find what ? you've got a "" salesman "" over here reading a three week old newspaper . he's pulling a 211 with a "" trucker "" , who happens to be packing a cop issue H &amp; K 9mm . I get tipped that something is going down when she passes me a note . how's that for twisted logic ? how did she know there was trouble unless they pulled the guns before I "" walked "" in ? and if that's true , why'd they stop and wait until I woke up to gaffle the money ? then I notice how beefy they both are . hell , even the waitress is cut . all three of them look like they went through the same training program . Ergo they ain't strangers and this isn't what it seems . that's how I knew yo-yo wouldn't get a round off even if I gave him all day . why ?",180
most guys we ran through this either took off or helped them rob the place . I expected you to do the same .,24,"that shows me already that you don't have a clue . what's it to you , anyway ?",18
"whether you thought this was for real or not , you jumped in and helped the waitress on instinct . that tells me something about your character .",28,good for you . now why don't you stop wasting my time and tell me what you want . you didn't go through all this for my benefit .,29
it's your lucky day . you just might get the chance to pay back our wonderful country for all the freedom you enjoy .,24,"a Fed , I shoulda known . who else would have this kind of budget ? now you're gonna hit me with the sales pitch .",26
"alright , cage , you've got me . this is one of those moments . "" many are called , few are chosen "" , that kind of thing . your government needs you . are you up for the challenge ?",42,".. If you're trolling around for narcs , man , have you got the wrong guy .",17
why is that ?,4,"look at me , dude , do I look like a fan of law enforcement ? forget the tests , you shoulda just asked me . I woulda saved you a lot of trouble .",35
"oh I don't know , I think the tests work pretty well . sometimes they give me answers you wouldn't admit to in a million years .",27,"are we done now ? you've got nothing on me . so if you ain't booking me , I'm walking .",21
"you've got this wrong . you're not under arrest , you've been abducted . and until I say different , you belong to me .",25,is that a fact ?,5
"sure as gravity . I've had a feeling about you from the start , cage . it's nausea .",19,you know what I hate ? any scumbag with a clean shirt and a bad haircut can get one of those tin stars and suddenly they think they're God .,30
"congratulations , you've just graduated at the head of your class .",12,you're a cold piece of work . you almost got three people killed out there .,16
"you want the cheap backstory ? the runaway mom , the suicide dad and the foster homes ? gimme a break . you're not interested in my past , you're interested in my future as some kind of spy .",40,"you're perceptive too . I forgot to add that to the list of surprises . I'm with the National Security Agency . and unlikely as it may sound , I need your help .",34
I'm not interested . I've already got a job .,10,you're an adrenaline junkie with one foot in the penitentiary . you risk your ass building a daredevil myth that means nothing and you're not getting any younger .,29
I plan on getting a lot older . and playing spy games sounds like a quick way to get yourself dead .,22,that's too bad . I thought a guy like you would appreciate the challenge .,15
now I'm the one who's nauseous . so what's the deal ? what do you need me for ?,19,"there's some folks I want to keep tabs on . dirty , tattooed , uncivilized . your kind of people .",21
what do I get out of it ?,8,"if you find out what I want to know , and if I'm able to successfully use that information , you get to go back to your degenerate little life . if not , you take a bath .",39
how about a pedicure as long as you're down there . what's this ? Lo-Jack ?,16,"wherever you go on the planet , I'll find you . there's no quitting . if you try to take it off , a ring of needles will inject enough curare into your bloodstream to kill you before you hit the ground . is all that clear ?",48

we're not after car thieves here .,7,what the hell am I after ? you're telling me dick .,12
"that information is classified . you're there to gather information on their operations , period .",16,"call me crazy , but I thought hooking up a million dollar deal was a great way to get on their good side . what else ? you gonna hassle me about the weapons and spy stuff too ?",39
"my friend , if you're planning on crossing me ...",10,"I know , poison needles in my shins . you've got 36 hours . peace , out .",18
"you did say "" Ahab "" ? you're sure about that ?",12,"yeah , I sent you pictures . here's what I'm thinking . if they take out the cameras and sensors , they could probably put a bomb in this thing . you drop it in the water in the Red Sea and three weeks later it's swimming up the Potomac .",51
"this is good work , X , damn fine work . you need to press on at all costs , find out what they have planned with this "" Ahab "" .",32,"hey , one miracle at a time . they're on to me now , remember ?",16

yes it does .,4,"come on , Gibbons , you can do better then that .",12

"yeah , that's right . so now that you know , you understand why it's important that we get it back .",22,"kinda funny , though , isn't it ? we're not supposed to be making weapons like that anyway . guess we shoulda played by the rules .",27
"somebody else makes those decisions , not guys like you and me . you've done your job , X , head back to Prague . I'll be landing in 90 minutes . this is my operation now .",38,"we don't have that kinda time , boss , I don't think Prague's gonna be around much longer . I've gotta go now .

"cut the crap , X , I saw you down there . you're a hero . don't be afraid to join the good guys .",25,who says you're the good guys ?,7
"you know what they say , the only way to change the system is from the inside .",18,oh yeah ? why don't we start by taking this thing off my ankle ? the poison needles ?,19
"on come on , X. Did you really think we were that barbaric ?",14,"no needles , huh ? what about the acid bath ?",11

what's your theory ?,4,life and death are unquantifiable abstracts . they don't concern me .,12
I guess you'll be dismantling Russian tanks soon .,9,you mean Afghanistan ? it won't require my attention . what I'm doing here is far more interesting .,19
"what ARE YOU DOING , VEIDT ?",7,Jon ! get back ! you don't understand .,9
Walter --,2,don't call me that .,5
Walter -- you're just telling me what you think I want to hear .,14,wrong answers ?,3

we ’ ve been pawns in someone ’ s game . they tricked us into bringing the money to King . not just elaborate . Cock-sure .,27,and expensive . cost three million plus .,8
do we have the range of Renard ’ s plane ?,11,"anywhere in this circle . Iran , Iraq , Pakistan , Syria , Afghanistan ...",15
it ’ s heading for the oil terminal .,9,where it can do the most damage .,8
any word from him ?,5,still no contact yet .,5
warm .,2,is it ?,3
"so beautiful . so smooth , so warm .",9,how would you know ?,5
why are you like this ? because Bond is dead ? it ’ s what you wanted .,18,of course ...,3

what ?,2,"to haul some cargo . my nephew , he is Captain of a sub in the Black Sea Fleet .",20
no ! bond !,4,bond !,2
what is this place ?,5,former KGB surveillance post . the dye Factory was just a front ; now it turns a good profit .,20
"in the good old days , the KGB had three or four spots where our submarines could surface without anyone knowing . but Yevgeny is supposed to be loading cargo .",31,what class sub does your nephew run ?,8
Valentin Zukovsky .,3,BondJamesBond . what brings you here ?,7
"you , of course . I need some information .",10,"bond , I ’ m a civilian . this is my place . used to be the royal family ’ s , now it ’ s mine . I run my little business , I stay out of trouble ...",40
"Mafia warlords , Diplomats and spies , consortiums from every country in the world . a nice little rat ’ s nest .",23,"have some of the rat ’ s nest caviar . from my own fishery . they buy my caviar , drink my champagne , lose to my House .",29
see ? you ’ re upsetting my customers . what do you want ?,14,how does a terrorist like Renard supply his men with state-of-the-art Russian Army weapons ?,15
what ? this is not possible .,7,if I remember my Cyrillic that says 101st airborne division .,11
where did you get this ?,6,off a high-powered Paraski that was trying to kill me .,11
that too . everyone does what they can to survive .,11,how high up does this ... arms dealing go ?,10
"bond . if someone wants you dead , it is Renard . our government has nothing to gain by killing you .",22,but you would have something to gain by killing Robert King . and stopping his pipeline .,17
she ’ s no innocent . this is my nuclear consultant .,12,"ah , I see . a purely ... plutonic relationship .",11
"really Bond , couldn ’ t you find a nice Russian scientist with hair growing out of his ears ?",20,what ’ s your business with Elektra King ?,9
I thought you were the one in her business .,10,she dropped a million and half dollars to the House -- your House . and you didn ’ t even bat an eyelid . she was paying you off . what for ?,33
now ... where were we ?,6,a rope !,3
"alright , alright ! sometimes I smuggle machinery for her . Russian stuff .",14,and the payoff on the tables ?,7
where ’ s the sub going ? !,8,no ! get me out !,6
this is too big for even you . where is it ?,12,"this is a family matter ! if my nephew is in danger , we do it my way , or nothing ! now get me out !",27
"so . my way . no MI-6 , no Interpol . just you , me and my people .",19,where ?,2
mother of God .,4,"the right kind of explosion in the right spot -- it would block the Bosphorus , cut off the Black Sea .",22
how appropriate .,3,I ’ d heard there were some renovations there ... no one would look for a sub in that place in a million years .,25
I met you at my father ’ s funeral .,10,yes .,2
funerals aren ’ t exactly memorable .,7,God no . all those horrible loved ones and relatives . I don ’ t want to talk to those people . I just want to ... talk to my father . I loved him . I ’ m not sure he knew that .,45
is that why you want to finish the pipeline ?,10,"partially , yes .",4
who is he ?,4,"my bodyguard . he follows me everywhere . he ’ s decisive , vigilant . and he makes an excellent omelette .",22
how long has he been with you ?,8,since the kidnapping . why do you ask ?,9
does this look familiar to you ?,7,it ’ s my father ’ s pin . he wore it everyday of his life .,17
are you trying to break my heart ? or is it just your way with women ?,17,"it ’ s not the pin your father wore . it ’ s an exact duplicate . inside is a tiny electrical detonator . we have reason to believe the assassin had an inside accomplice , someone who worked at this company .",43
"if you ’ ve come here to look after me , Mr. Bond , thank you , but no thank you . I have two bodyguards , I don ’ t need a third ...",35,"the killer doesn ’ t want to see this pipeline continue , doesn ’ t want to see you take over ...",22
"that ’ s every man within a five mile radius . including you . that ’ s why you ’ re here , isn ’ t it ? you think I can ’ t do it . you think I ’ m going to screw up . or get myself killed .",52,I think running this pipeline would be a difficult job for anyone . especially King ’ s daughter .,19
I have to check the upper lines . Gabor will drive you back .,14,always wanted to see the upper lines .,8
"you don ’ t take no for an answer , do you ?",13,no .,2
oh my God ... we ’ re buried alive ...,10,we ’ re alright .,5
I can ’ t stay here .,7,you ’ re not going to .,7
no ! it will cave in !,7,it ’ s the only way out ...,8
I can ’ t stay .,6,I know .,3
"the way I acted , in the snow ... you must think I ’ m a coward .",18,I think you ’ re one of the Bravest people I ’ ve ever met .,16
what is it ?,4,... you should rest .,5
I have to go .,5,then take me with you .,6
no . you ’ ll be safe here .,9,I don ’ t want to be safe !,9
vodka martini .,3,two . shaken not stirred .,6
what the hell are you doing here ?,8,"someone wants to kill me , I ’ d rather die looking him straight in the eye . what are you doing here ? looking for a woman a little more your type ? how about that one ?",39
"if this little show is for my benefit , I ’ ll take you home right now .",18,"you had your chance , James . now I ’ m looking for a bigger thrill .",17
I understand it ’ s normally good practice to get the feel of the cards before going off the deep end .,22,really ?,2
surely you believe in living dangerously .,7,not at that price . time to surrender .,9
you knew when you first saw me . you knew it would be like this .,16,shush .,2
how did you survive ?,5,I used my body on the guards . it gave me control . I got to a gun and I took my chance . I ’ ve never told anyone that .,32
what ’ s wrong with you ? are you crazy ?,11,"a little . does it matter ? after all , what ’ s the point of living if you can ’ t feel alive ? isn ’ t that right , Elektra ? isn ’ t that your motto ?",40
what are you talking about ?,6,or did you steal it from your old friend Renard ?,11
... what ?,3,"we had a run-in , he and I. He knew about us , he knew about my shoulder , he knew exactly where to hurt me ...",27
are you saying ... Renard is the man who ’ s trying to kill me ?,16,"you can drop the act , it ’ s over .",11
I don ’ t know what you ’ re talking about !,12,I think you do .,5
"how dare you ! how dare you ! that animal ! ? that monster ! ? he disgusts me ! you disgust me ! so he knew where to hurt you , is that it ? you had a sling on your arm at the funeral ! I didn ’ t have to sleep with you to find that out .",61,he used your exact words .,6
I ’ m coming with you .,7,"you do what you have to do , but I ’ ve called in M. She ’ s en route from London even now .",25
I could have given you the world .,8,not interested .,3
where ’ s M ?,5,soon she ’ ll be everywhere .,7
"all this , because you fell for Renard ?",9,five more turns and your neck will break .,9
"since I was a child , I ’ ve always had a power over men . when I realized my father wouldn ’ t rescue me from the kidnappers , I knew I had to form a new alliance .",40,you turned Renard .,4
so you killed your father .,6,he killed me ! he killed me the day he refused to pay my ransom .,16
was this all about the oil ?,7,it is my oil ! mine and my family ’ s !,12
"it runs in my veins , thicker than blood . I ’ m going to redraw the map . and when I am through the whole world will know my name , my grandfather ’ s name , the glory of my people .",44,no-one will believe this melt-down was an accident .,9
one ... last ... screw ?,6,oh James .,3
"beautiful , isn ’ t it ?",7,yes .,2
"today , of all days , the sun decides to shine .",12,perhaps Sir Robert had a word with the Man Upstairs .,11
a word ? I ’ m sure by now he ’ s engineered a hostile takeover .,17,you knew him well ?,5
he was my father .,5,I ’ m sorry .,5
I see my friend Davidov ran into some difficulty .,10,indeed .,2
revenge isn ’ t so hard to fathom . what ’ s clever is getting someone else to pay for it .,22,not many people in this world have that kind of fortune .,12
who is it ?,4,"you think I fear death ? I welcome it . I get on my knees and pray for it . you , on the other hand , you have something to live for , no ? she ’ s beautiful isn ’ t she ? you should have seen her before . Flawless , and still so innocent , not such a whore in bed ...",66
you will never touch her . you will never get near her .,13,have you forgotten who saved your life in Geneva ?,10
consider me ungrateful .,4,it ’ s I who should thank you -- for taking that money back to MI-6 . so distressing for M. An explosion inside her lair .,27
she ’ ll get over it .,7,you even brought the plane for us . we really couldn ’ t have done it without you .,19
in case you ’ ve forgotten . I ’ m dead already .,13,haven ’ t you heard the news ? so is she .,12
"not the usual Swiss procedure , Mr. Bond , but you understand , a man in my position ..",19,"which is neutral , no doubt .",7
I did not get the report from an MI-6 agent .,11,who did you get it from ?,7
I am just a middle man . I am doing the honourable thing and returning the money to its rightful owner ...,22,and we know how difficult that can be for the Swiss .,12
your last chance . take the money .,8,your last chance . give me the name .,9
the name ?,3,"I can ’ t tell you ... Alright , alright ! but you must protect me !",17
construction ’ s not exactly my line .,8,"quite the opposite , in fact .",7
old friend ?,3,since Oxford . I knew him when he had nothing but a brilliant mind and enough guts to conquer the world . he ’ s a man of great integrity .,31
she ’ s not a girl anymore .,8,I ’ ve scheduled a medical for you .,9
it ’ s barely a scratch . the Dome broke my fall .,13,"well , at least it turned out to have some purpose .",12
007 . what do you know of the Caspian Sea ?,11,"caviar capital of the world . Matchless Beluga . firm , yet subtle . largest landlocked body of water on Earth . Oil-rich . Hitler wanted it . Stalin beat him to it .",34
who told you to look at Elektra ’ s files ?,11,I took the initiative .,5
I was the one who brought that money in ...,10,"I ’ m well aware of your stake in this , 007 . if you have a point , get to it .",23
it ’ s a message . he wants us to know he ’ s back .,16,who ?,2
Claude Serrault . A.K.A ...,5,Renard .,2
"sir Robert tried to deal with the kidnapping with his own ... resources , at first . when Elektra ’ s ear was delivered to him in the post , he came to me . I advised against paying the ransom . I knew it was Renard . I played it out as long as possible to get a fix on him .",63,sacrifice the girl to take out the terrorist ?,9
he survived ?,3,"the doctor who saved him couldn ’ t get it out , so Renard killed him . when Interpol found the X-rays , there was mild jubilation . Effectively , he ’ s a dead man .",37
"the bullet is moving through the medulla oblongata , killing off his sense of touch . he feels no pain . he can push himself harder , longer than any normal man .",33,‘ That which does not kill me makes me stronger . ’,12
now Robert is dead . he got his revenge .,10,he ’ s not through yet . Renard doesn ’ t blow up five million dollars unless he knows there ’ s more coming in . he ’ s working for someone . someone who wants to stop the pipeline . and they hired the perfect killer . one with a vendetta against King ... and you .,58
"get out to the pipeline . find the insider who switched the pin . if your instincts are right , Renard will be back . he hasn ’ t completed the job . the pipeline is still going forward , and we have Elektra to thank for that .",49,the worm on the hook again .,7
the report King bought . it ’ s a manual . Renard ’ s men used it to remove this radio tracking device from the warhead .,27,then Robert was right about a Russian connection .,9
the inside man ?,4,is maybe ... the inside woman .,7
dislocated collar bone . if any more tendons snap ... It won ’ t just be two weeks out of action .,22,"I need you to pass me fit now , Molly .",11
it ’ s just a scratch .,7,James . it wouldn ’ t really be ...,9
then maybe I ’ d be ... open to that .,11,perhaps after this ... test ?,6
... yes ? ...,4,I could come for a second opinion ?,8
you new ?,3,"yes . Viktor Davidov , Miss ... ?",8
"doctor . Jones . Christmas Jones . no jokes , I ’ ve heard them all .",17,don ’ t know any doctor jokes .,8
what happened to Len Tashka ?,6,couldn ’ t make it . splitting headache .,9
he is an impostor . there ’ s no Davidov at Miratom .,13,"here ’ s your imposter . he ’ s paid off the men on the plane outside . they ’ re not taking the bomb to any Russian facility , they ’ re flying it wherever he tells them .",40
shame you had to spot I wasn ’ t the real thing .,13,so who are you ?,5
when this is over we should bury the hatchet . celebrate . a champagne dinner ?,16,when this is over our bodies may be blown to smithereens .,12
the plutonium is missing . they ’ ve taken the core !,12,then it ’ s no longer a bomb ?,9
what the hell were you doing ? you nearly killed us !,12,I did kill us . she thinks we ’ re dead . and she thinks she got away with it .,21
what the hell are you talking about ?,8,it ’ s part of some plan . she dresses it up like a terrorist attack . the explosion covers up the theft of the plutonium .,27
who ’ s she ?,5,Elektra King .,3
Elektra King ? are you insane ? this is her pipeline .,12,makes her look even more innocent .,7
what would she want with weapons grade plutonium ?,9,I was hoping you could tell me .,8
what is it ?,4,she just upped the stakes . all her chips are on the table now . and M ’ s life is part of the bet .,26
nuclear .,2,"not just nuclear . powered by a nuclear reactor . he ’ s not loading any cargo . they want the sub . the sub itself . put weapons grade plutonium inside the sub ’ s reactor : instant , catastrophic meltdown .",43
"but why ? eight million people would die , the land irradiated for a hundred years . a cloud of radiation the size of Europe ...",26,because an explosion like that would kill all the other pipelines . there would be only one way to get the oil out of the Caspian and pump it to the world ...,33
the King pipeline .,4,Elektra would control it all .,6
Zukovsky ...,2,"if I don ’ t get to the Boa before he gets to Maiden ’ s Tower , M is dead .",22
is there another way ?,5,we go down to the torpedo bay .,8
he ’ s sealed himself in .,7,he ’ s going to insert the plutonium .,9
do you know what you ’ re doing ?,9,like riding a bike .,5
what kind of bikes did you ride ?,8,just wanted to put him on edge ...,8
count to twenty . when you get to twenty open the hatch . it can only be opened for a few seconds or we ’ ll sink .,28,but what if ...,4
I love Christmas in Turkey .,6,so isn ’ t it time you unwrapped your present ?,11
"as for you , my galvanized friend , you want a heart ! you don't know how lucky you are not to have one . hearts will never be practical until they can be made unbreakable . I could have been a world figure , a power among men , a - a successful wizard , had I not been obstructed by a heart .",65,but I still want one .,6
stop that dog !,4,this is a highly irregular procedure ! this is absolutely unprecedented !,12
oh ! help me ! the balloon's going up !,10,-- ruined my exit !,5
help !,2,"uh - now , please don't be angry with me . I'll - I'll do anything you say , only ... only if you don't shout at me . it makes me nervous !",34
it makes you nervous ?,5,yes .,2
what about us ?,4,"well , I --",4
what about the heart that you promised Tin Man -- ?,11,"well , I --",4
-- And the courage that you promised cowardly Lion ?,10,"well , I --",4
well --,2,you promised us real things -- a real ...,9
"therefore , by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Universitatus Committeeatum e plurbis unum , I hereby confer upon you the honorary degree of Th.D.",28,Th.D. ?,2
how can I ever thank you enough ?,8,"well , you can't . as for you , my fine friend -- you're a victim of disorganized thinking . you are under the unfortunate delusion that simply because you run away from danger , you have no courage . you're confusing courage with wisdom . back where I come from , we have men who are called heroes . once a year , they take their fortitude out of mothballs and parade it down the main street of the city . and they have no more courage than you have . but ! they have one thing that you haven't got ! a medal ! therefore -- for meritorious ....",111
beautiful ! what an echo !,6,it's empty . the tinsmith forgot to give me a heart .,12
"I'm not afraid of her . I'll see you get safely to the Wizard now , whether I get a brain or not ! stuff a mattress with me ! hah !",32,"I'll see you reach the Wizard , whether I get a heart of not . Bee-hive -- bah ! let her try and make a bee-hive out of me ! you know -- hmm ? what's that ?",38
"no , sir !",4,"no , sir !",4

animals that -- that eat straw ?,7,"some -- but mostly lions , and tigers , and bears .",12

help ! help ! help ! help ! help !,10,"oh ! well , what happened to you ?",9
"they tore my legs off , and they threw them over there ! then they took my chest out , and they threw it over there !",27,"well , that's you all over .",7
who do you suppose they were ? and where did they take her ? a fine thing - to go to pieces at a time like this !,28,"now , now , don't fret .",7

"Eli , John is a carpenter . as well as being a fine policeman .",15,"eh ? well then , maybe he can go to Zook's barn-raising , eh ? see how good a carpenter .",21
how can this be ? how can you do such a thing ? is this plain ? is this the ordnung ?,22,I have done nothing against the ordnung .,8

Fred . the way he looked when you screamed at him .,12,"God , Fred ...",4
at home you'd never hear a woman scream at a man that way .,14,no ? why not ?,5
you just wouldn't . it's not the Amish way . but I think it would have done me good if I could have screamed at your brother last night .,30,"listen , I don't know what's going on or how you got mixed up with him , but don't you let that self-righteous son of a bitch push you around , okay ?",33

"Elaine , I don't want to have to take you in for questioning . you've got his car , you were the last to see him –",27,I don't know where he is .,7

where are you taking us ?,6,we're looking for a suspect . we've reason to believe he's still in the area .,16
you have no right to keep us here .,9,yes I do . your son is a material witness to a homicide .,14
"you don't understand , we have nothing to do with your laws !",13,doesn't surprise me . I meet a lot of people like that .,13
what was that ?,4,he wants to know who you are . your name . I told him we don't need to know anything about you .,23
the problem is I don't happen to think my son should be spending all his time with a man who carried a gun under his coat and goes around whacking people .,32,whacking ?,2
yes . and I also want to leave this city .,11,"believe me , I'm trying to get this over with as fast as I can . but Samuel will probably have to come back and testify .",27
we do not go into your courts .,8,people who don't go into our courts when they're told to sometimes go directly into our jail .,18
"look , I'm genuinely sorry ...",6,"no you're not – You're glad , because now you've got a witness . I heard the other police talking last night . they don't seem to like you very much .",32
they kid a lot .,5,I would not be too sure .,7
but not a good tired .,6,what's a' good' tired . tired is tired .,9
your sister said you don't have a family ?,9,no .,2
she thinks you should get married and have children of your own . instead of trying to be a father to hers . except she thinks you're afraid of the responsibility .,32,oh ? anything else ?,5
why don't you arrest that man ? are you protecting him because policeman ?,14,"listen , I'm the cop that polices the police . I'm not in the business of protecting crooked cops . I'll make an arrest when I know everybody involved .",30
but why would they murder ...,6,"because – somehow – they knew I was getting close . look , it's narcotics ... They make dope out of chemicals ... they sell it on the street for millions of dollars . they'll do anything . and they can get away with it because they're cops .",49
I'm afraid . I'm afraid for Samuel . I want to go home .,14,you'll be safe . you don't have to worry .,10
home .,2,you couldn't wait until morning ?,6
you said we would be safe in Philadelphia .,9,I was wrong .,4
stay for awhile . rest . I'll make coffee and breakfast .,12,I can't .,3
but John ... why didn't you go to a hospital ?,11,"no , no doctor ...",5
but why ?,3,gunshot ... they'll file reports ... they'll find me .,10
who are they ?,4,"the leadership of our district ... the diener . Bishop Tschantz is the one with no hair on top . they decided to come and see you for themselves . except Stoltzfus , of course . he came the first day . I think he saved your life .",49
only the elders .,4,how long ?,3
what ?,2,how long have I been here ?,7
two days .,3,"listen , thank you . thanks for everything . but I've got to go .",15
"John Book , I would appreciate it if , during the time you are with us , you would have as little to do with Samuel as possible .",29,nobody meant any harm . the boy was curious . I unloaded the gun -,15

we had some lemonade and he left .,8,a real fireball .,4
you know carpentry ?,4,I did some carpentry summers when I was going to school .,12
what else can you do ?,6,I can whack people . I'm hell at whacking .,10
whacking is not of much use on a farm .,10,now hold on . there's a lot of people who think being a cop is a legitimate job .,19
but ... You may not be well enough .,9,I'll drink some more of Stoltzfus' tea .,8
when will you be going ?,6,not long ... A few days .,7
won him over just like that .,7,I see . but I hope you have a lot of sugar . Eli is ready to go to Zook's .,21
you should not bother with that birdhouse . if you're leaving tomorrow .,13,I'm leaving tonight . I'm going to need my clothes . and my gun .,15
there was a time when I thought you might have stayed .,12,there was .,3
there was a time when I would have welcomed it .,11,I know .,3
I was being foolish ?,5,no . I was being unrealistic . even thinking about living this life .,14
you're so sure of that ?,6,aren't you ? after today ?,6
"I'm not so sure of anything as you are , John Book . you could live this life if you wanted to bad enough . just as I could live yours !",32,"oh , come on , Rachel . no way .",10
there is always a way ! but you are such a ... a Glotzkopp you cannot see ! you'd rather go back to that city ! to nothing ! no woman ! no children ! no land !,38,land ! are you crazy ? I'm no Amishman and I'm no farmer ! I'm a cop . that's what I know and that's what I do !,28
what you do is take vengeance ! which is a sin against heaven !,14,"that's your way , not mine .",7
that's God's way !,4,"well in the City of Philadelphia , God needs a little help !",13
I want you to take this ... to remember by .,11,where's my baggy pants ?,5

so one of them got to him .,8,maybe .,2
you know who ?,4,maybe .,2
you're still convinced there's a link to the department ?,10,if there isn't I've just wasted the last six months .,11
that's the problem . we need results . the press is driving us crazy over this P2P thing . calling us the' speed capitol of the country' . you know the sort of thing . it's getting political . the Commissioner's getting very uneasy .,45,"the Amish boy saw him , Paul . I'll make it , but Set Donahue and the Homicide Department off my back or they'll blow the whole thing .",29
what's-her-name moved to Buffalo .,5,"well , anyway , don't get crazy . I'll do something for Zenovich's wife .",15
last guy I would have figured . but he's part of it .,13,I hope you don't have any doubts about that .,10
"if I did , I'd have kept my mouth shut ... It fits , Paul ... fifty-five gallons of P2P confiscated four years ago ... Guess who was in on the collar ? Mac . he salts it away somewhere ... he knows the stuff is potent , but the street chemists haven't figured out how to process it . but they do now . and now the stuff is worth five-grand a pint and there are a lot of pints in a fifty-five gallon drum .",87,who else knows ?,4
just us .,3,"okay , what are you going to need to clean it up",12
more people ... Gotta pick up where Zenovich left off . people from outside the department .,17,"maybe the Bureau . or those bastards at Treasury . I'll take care of it . I hate this shit , Johnny . you cut their balls off for me . I'm counting on you .",36

"hey , Sam ...",4,... I want to say a thing .,8

"if you rest the baby on your shoulder , she'll stop crying .",13,shut up .,3
I changed her already !,5,"she needs to be changed again . Sorsha crosses her arms in a hugg and watches as Willow changes the baby . soon the baby stops crying . re- lieved yet still anxious , Sorsha paces to a mirror .

I can't .,3,let me see it .,5

Gawd ... you're ... beautiful ...,6,you're not a woman .,5
"Mmmm , I love the smell of a woman .",10,my step-father's going to tear you apart .,8
I do what I'm told .,6,too bad you're not more like your father .,9

"now , you know where you're going ? down there , through those trees , follow the river . you'll know the crossroads by a big daikini struc- ture . Willow , this is serious business . don't waste any time , the outer world is no place for a Nelwyn . give the baby to the first daikini you see , then hurry home as fast as you can .",71,"if I'm not strong enough to be your apprentice , how can I do this ?",16
"you're strong enough . but you're going to need courage , Willow .",13,"I don't want courage . I don't want to be a warrior . all I've ever wanted was to do magic , real magic , like you !",28
"oh , if I could do that I'd--I'd turn Burglekutt into a toad !",14,"waste magic on revenge ? you have much to learn , Willow ...",13
Willow Ufgood .,3,yes ... ?,3
"you mean , you know who this baby belongs to ?",11,she belongs to all of us . she is the future queen and ruler of all kingdoms on earth .,20
"no , Willow . your journey has just begun . it has been foretold that this child shall bring about the Downfall of Queen Bavmorda , whose evil powers have darkened our world . upon you depends this princess's life .",41,me ?,2
"you are the guardian , Willow . you must take her to Tir Asleen .",15,what is Tir Asleen ?,5
you need a warrior for this job . I'm nobody .,11,"you are very important , Willow .",7
they look like acorns .,5,anything you hurl them at will turn to stone .,10
"we're going into battle , little one . find a woman to take care of it .",17,"he thought you were a woman , Airk !",9
Madmartigan ! what did you do this time ?,9,nothing you wouldn't have done it my place !,9

"you left me to die , friend .",8,you managed alright .,4
"it's you they're after , Madmarti- gan . what did you do this time ?",15,they're not after me . they want the baby .,10
"you gonna be a hero , Madmartigan ? I've lost half my men fighting Kael , and Bavmorda , and the Nock- maar army . now you and this Peck , and that magpie up in the rafters , are gonna take' em on alone ?",46,then come with us .,5
you're chasing a dream .,5,just get me some horses .,6
"out for a little ride in the coun- try , Airk ?",12,"thought you might get lonely , mad- martigan !",9
"thank you , friend .",5,let's go .,3

when are they coming ?,5,they're rounding up a posse . figure an hour ?,10
in an hour they're gone !,6,hey ... !,3
"you're not going to use it , are you ?",10,"well , come on , that's half a dozen armed men ...",12
yes !,2,gotta get the Doctor someplace safe .,7
who were they ? what do they want with me ?,11,we'll explain on the way .,6
"I only met him once , but that was enough . for such a little man he had quite an oversized opinion of himself . he offered me the "" rare and unparalleled opportunity "" to develop a new steam engine for him . he claims to have some sort of factory in Texas , I believe . said I could have the run of the place . he had all sorts of specifications . but when I questioned him closely , it became obvious he was just another mercenary businessman . both he and his partner had no real love of steam . it's sad . so few men do .",112,who was this partner of his ?,7
"a Southern gentlemen . I don't recall his name . I suppose it's unkind of me to say it , but he had the most disconcerting glass eye .",29,"a glass eye ? that's who it was ! one-eyed Jack Garrison . otherwise known as General Garrison , Confederate Third Army . I saw him at Dr. Loveless' party , but I couldn't place him . he used to wear an eye-patch .",44
are you all right ?,5,for the moment . but I fear not for long . I'm of no use to him now .,19
"he ... he's planning to kill us , isn't he ?",11,he's just full of plans that aren't gonna work out .,11
it's a smelting retort .,5,now it's a bomb .,5
I beg your pardon ?,5,you don't know what he's built ? ! surely you don't think he kidnapped all those geniuses to have them make something as rudimentary as this .,27
I admire a man with a sense of humor .,10,"when you're three and a half feet tall , sir , life turns you into a comedian whether you like it or not .... Come with me , won't you ?",31
I must compliment you on Miss Thompson ... an exceptionally charming assistant .,13,thank you . I confess to a preoccupation with acquiring precisely that which the world says I cannot have .,20
"very good , sir ! I think my guest might be a sharpshooter by trade .",16,"no , sir ... just a businessman .",8
really ? must be a dangerous business .,8,I deal with some tough customers .,7
sir ... I believe you have only two barrels .,10,how embarrassing . did I hold up three fingers ?,10
"why don't we just cut this routine short ? whatever you do to us , we're not going to talk .",21,talk ? about what ... ? oh ! about who you are and all that ?,16
you're not that big .,5,"restrain yourself , Voltaire . he's just the sort of coward who would shoot an unarmed giant .",18
still alive . hmm . I suppose that doesn't bode well for poor Bruno .,15,he had a pressing engagement .,6
Philistine .,2,you got that right . now get up . we're walking out of here .,15
has it penetrated that adrenaline- addled skull that you are surrounded by seventy-eight of my loyal followers ? you are in my domain !,24,has it penetrated yours that I'm holding a gun on their leader ?,13
the U.S. is my jurisdiction .,6,exactly ! you are on foreign soil . you are a representative of the occupying forces . or haven't you checked a map lately ? !,26
these lands were taken by force from Mexico in the illegal War of American aggression .,16,that would be ... the Mexican War ?,8
I've even printed my own currency .,7,""" Emperor Miguelito ... ? """,6
the first .,3,"well , your highness , what makes you think we'll ever sign a treaty with you ?",17
"because I am holding all the western territories hostage , Mr. West ! a town a day will disappear ! Willard was merely a test run , a stroll in the park . next , I level all of Albuquerque ! yes , that's right . only yesterday I learned what you undoubtedly already know : your own President will be there . what an added bonus ! the gods are shining on me ! after tomorrow every American citizen will rise up and demand I be given back my humble little empire !",94,"so , I'm the only one here who can tell the difference between an Emperor and a murderer ?",19
"Mr. President , good to see you again , sir . sorry about all that .",16,"that'll be all , boys .",6
good work . really .,5,this is Colonel Richards .,5
but what would anyone have to gain from all this ... ? unless it were a foreign power .,19,exactly . any number of nations would love to cripple our scientific growth . and what better way to tip the scales in their favor than by killing off the greatest minds this country has produced .,37
we find ourselves at the dawn of the Golden Age of Science . and it is the God-given destiny of this glorious nation to carry the torch that lights the way !,32,"nicely said , sir .",5
and ?,2,and now the job's yours .,6
"... well , of course you can . Mr. President , what a surprise . what brings you here ?",20,on my way to Denver ...,6
where'd he say he was going to do this ?,10,he didn't . that's your job . I'm taking you off that other case until you've nabbed this lunatic . good luck . nice train . but mine's nicer .,30
"don't try to bamboozle me , Colonel . has another scientist been kidnapped or not ?",16,"well , yes sir . a Professor Morton , but with just a little more time , sir , I can assure you a breakthrough on this case ...",29
"listen , in two days I'm embarking on a tour of the western territories . and I want to know at least one problem is being handled competently in my absence .",32,"of course , sir , that's why I've assigned a new man . and he's no ordinary Marshal . he's quite sophisticated . three college degrees . a master of disguise . speaks French ...",35
French ?,2,yes sir .,3
"French ? damn it , I want my own man on this case . somebody I trust . somebody who doesn't mind breaking up the furniture !",27,"why surely , Mr. President , there must be some mistake . I mean ...",15
"look , I'm Captain James West ...",7,"well , Captain , then the answer is your train is still here .",14
"your private train , sir .",6,private train ?,3
"would you be thinking ... ramming speed , sir ?",10,"I would , Mr. Doyle ! are you game ?",10
"my name's Tyler . Frank Tyler . pleased to meet you , ma'am .",14,"I get that feeling . you know , Mr. Tyler , I'm the kind of woman who doesn't believe men are much more than a complete waste of time . but after spying you across the room , I'm tempted to suspend my disbelief , at least for the evening .",51
"you know , ma'am , you remind me of a pearl-handled pistol I once owned . a beautiful thing to look at , but too hot to handle .",29,I don't recollect ever being compared to a pistol before .,11
please do . I'm a man who appreciates a good firearm .,12,really ?,2
"well , where I come from it kind of goes with the territory . Texas .",16,my ... the wild west .,6
"well , sir , you are proving to be one of my more interesting guests .",16,"your guests , ma'am ?",5
"well , I owe you one , don't I ?",10,you most certainly do .,5
you must excuse the Doctor . no one has ever beaten him at his little game .,17,"I don't like to lose , either .",8
"have you taken a wrong turn , Mr. Tyler ?",10,you tell me .,4
"forgive me , but you don't strike me as the social secretary type .",14,"thank you . but the truth is , I'm a single woman in a man's world . that leaves me very few choices , doesn't it ?",27
just a little insurance ... against the unexpected .,9,would that include me ?,5
"oh , I would hope not .",7,you've ... done ... this ... before .,8
she's perfectly safe .,4,really ? like General Garrison or didn't you hear all that shooting ?,13
my . it's gotten longer .,6,you bring the best out in a man .,9
"you know , I really hate being toyed with before someone shoots me .",14,"fine , I'll stop .",5
a new friend ?,4,we'll see .,3
anyone ?,2,here . Mr. Tyler . he claims a certain skill at handling firearms .,14
they don't even realize they should be frightened .,9,"well , let's help them with that . take the legs .",12
"terribly sorry . I'm always sticking this where it doesn't belong . Federal agents , ma'am . we're rescuing a kidnap victim ...",23,"yes , me !",4
he's not giving up ?,5,"well , see , he had this little wagon when he was a kid ...",15
"time for you to get off , Ma'am .",9,like hell ! I'll see it through ! Ram the bastard !,12
J. S. Bach .,4,Jim West .,3
"Artemus Gordon . Bach , he's the composer .",9,"I don't mind him , but who the hell are you ... my valet or something ?",17
valet ? you jest of course . I am a U.S. Marshal .,13,funny . so am I.,5
"congratulations . unfortunately , my train is about to leave , and I really must insist you disembark .",19,"your train ? listen , friend , you're obviously lost . ... I've got orders here to take possession of this train and to investigate a certain crime .",29
"interesting . mine say the same thing , and they don't mention you , not even as a valet , although we could talk ...",25,"just another bureaucratic foul-up . you know how these pencil-pushers are . so , why don't you just run on back and explain what happened ?",26
"funny , I was just thinking you should do the same . since I am already in residence , and am obviously the man for the job , it's been grand making your acquaintance , sir . and best of luck in all your future endeavors .",47,"you're quite the wordsmith , fiddle boy . but nobody smooth-talks his way into my assignment .",17
but don't pull that again .,6,wouldn't dream of it .,5
"eight scientists . eight different fields of endeavor . Hydraulics , optics , ballistics ...",15,put them all together and what do we have ?,10
a giant ... hydraulically operated microscope ... that explodes ? or maybe just someone who hates scientists .,18,then why kidnap them ? why not just kill them ?,11
wait a minute . now I know where I've heard of you . you're the gadget guy .,18,""" gadget guy ? "" while I may not be in a league with these unfortunate geniuses , I am , sir , in my own humble way , a man of science .",34
"attractive buttons , yes ? but yank one off , toss it , and poof ! it emits a cloud of sleeping gas .",24,you need that real often ?,6
always hoping . or this ...,6,"no offense , but all I ever need ... Are these ... And this .",15
"all right , if it'll make you happy , I'll try that .",13,try what ?,3
your little jack-in-the-box gun . that might be useful .,10,well ... it's the only one I have . it's gotten me out of quite a few tight spots ...,20
that should put us ahead of the criminals .,9,I'll work on it .,5
Aha !,2,Aha ?,2
"yes , aha . a brass screw .",8,is this leading somewhere ?,5
potentially . this is the painstaking process of piecing together clues . the cornerstone of the modern science of criminology . piece by piece we reconstruct the identity of the villain .,32,starting with a screw ?,5
"yes . starting with a screw . now , it's not fair of me to expect someone who's spent his life wrangling with Western desperadoes to fully appreciate what I'm doing here , but ...",35,what about the explosive ?,5
Limestone quarry ?,3,"Limestone quarry , Southern mansion . easy to get them mixed up ... I say we invite ourselves to the party .",22
"Doyle , once around the park . I need a moment to prepare .",14,prepare what ?,3
"come Llewellyn , don't tarry .",6,"call me that again , and you're going to find a boot where it doesn't belong .",17
that's a lot of butler .,6,"quite . come , let's mingle .",7
"doctor V. L. Pemberton . I knew it . he's a scientist all right . Inventor of the Pemberton condensed steam engine . I'm telling you , Artemus , Loveless is our man .",34,"whoa , Jim . maybe . but we can't arrest this little pillar of society on maybe .",18
you know your Morse Code almost as well as I.,10,almost ?,2
"yes . now , observe ....",6,you feeling all right ?,5
"you're either having a seizure or you just said "" hello . """,13,"good , I wasn't sure you were up to it .",11
what was all that back there ?,7,all what ?,3
all that jumping and kicking .,6,"that ? oh , it's a kind of Chinese fighting ... I was sort of caught once with a lovely Chinese girl out in San Francisco . her big brothers were kind enough to teach it to me I've got a book on it , if you're interested .",49
"Garrison ... ? then the President was right . except it's not a foreign power , it's a bunch of die- hard Rebels trying to make the South rise again .",31,and if they've got Dr. Loveless building weapons like those flying bombs ... they just might do it .,19
"could I just point out , this is a perfect example of the criminal mind exploiting modern invention .",19,I'm going to hit you .,6
at least I tried something .,6,"hey , I tried the board .",7
"damn it , this is ridiculous .",7,"at least the thing's not that fast . we just follow it . whenever it stops , we're there , waiting .",22
"Jim , are you all right ?",7,"no , I'm not all right . they got away . and we can't even follow them . they can get off the tracks anywhere they want .",28
what way is that ?,5,so ... spontaneous . all that leaping off buildings and Chinese fighting and whatnot .,15
""" spontaneous . "" I like that . most people say something like "" hare- brained reckless son-of-a-bitch . """,20,"well ... that , too .",6
nothing much to it really . when I was younger I got into a pretty bad run-in with the Wyler Boys . I saw them coming . but I didn't act fast enough . Second-guessed myself . and it cost me ... cost me dearly .,46,so ... what happened ?,5
"those kids , they took my wagon . never got it back .",13,uh ... how long ago was this ?,8
you might have mentioned you had that .,8,I thought all you needed were your fists and your gun .,12
strange ... you'd think he'd have this place better guarded .,11,I find most criminals slip up somewhere ...,8
they're so precious when they're asleep .,7,"you really enjoy yourself , don't you ?",8
can you fill me in here ?,7,sure . we have no idea what's going on .,10
thank you .,3,"come on , let's at least see if we can find Dr. Pemberton .",14
know what this is ?,5,sure . it's a wind-up ... thing .,8
this is good .,4,shhh ! come on . tell us something !,9
"oh , damn ! that's it .",7,it's better than nothing .,5
sounds like a train . looks like a train .,10,yes . and a much nicer one than ours .,10
Willard ...,2,it's not a guy ...,5
relax . we're almost there .,6,we oughta get a couple of those rockets . Voom ! we're there before we left !,17
what is that ?,4,"this ? I'm testing a new spirit gum , to see how it holds .",15
and people are actually fooled by that ?,8,"my disguises have helped me solve many a difficult case . I spent three years on the stage , you know . remind me sometime to regale you with my Lear .",32
not again .,3,I adjusted it .,4
"when we find him , he is mine .",9,"oh , no , we split him fifty-fifty .",9
what if these tracks are just leading us to an Indian village or some old coot's mining claim ?,19,"not likely . there must be tracks of twenty different wagons . freight wagons , carriages , buckboards ...",19
"excellent detective work , sir . you should have the honor of going first .",15,"oh , thank you .",5
my pleasure .,3,"Artemus , you ready for this ? his next target is Albuquerque .",13
what ? President Grant is ... !,7,I know ! I know !,6
I don't have to tell you what that would do to our careers !,14,"we've got to stop him right here , now ! with that armored steam engine of his it'll be a slaughter .",22
"I'd love to stop him , but have you noticed the hundred armed men ?",15,there's only seventy-eight .,4
it was in your book .,6,"well , hell , maybe we do have a chance .",11
are those just button buttons or ... ?,8,of course not .,4
"God in heaven , what is that ? !",9,that's ... that's the criminal mind about to stomp our sorry butts !,13
my God ! he's so excessive !,7,where have you been ?,5
pull the balloon right in front of him ! we'll board the damn thing !,15,"oh , I see , an easy plan !",9
the machine was stopped ! it seemed like a perfect time to disable it ! why'd you have to throw it into full throttle ? !,26,he was going to shoot me ! do you mind ? !,12
"all right , all right ... It'll be okay . I mean , eventually it'll just run out of steam .",21,in the next two minutes ?,6
"Artemus ! look at that . brand spanking new . she's a beauty , huh ? let's get rolling .",20,what is this ? a whole new train ?,9
what ? you're going to drive off without even saying hi ?,12,"hi , Sandy .",4
"why don't you come in , have a drink ?",10,can't . got a passenger .,6
"I can't , Sandy . I've got to run .",10,"I'll bet . look , Sam . why don't you come by this weekend . we'll take the boat out ...",21
"sorry , Sandy . I've got plans .",8,what ? running over alligators with that silly swamp jalopy when you could be sailing a real boat ...,19
Sandy ... What's up ?,5,"listen , Kelly skipped school . have you talked to her ?",12
shit . here we go again .,7,didn't you see her this morning ?,7
look . I know you're seeing Barbara Baxter . so what ?,12,so maybe I'm a one-woman man .,7
"grab a clue , Sam . you're a hired hand around here . enjoy it while it lasts .",19,"goodbye , Sandra .",4
how much is about six and a half million divided by three ?,13,Jesus . two million one hundred thirty-three thousand three hundred thirty-three and change .,14
Sam ...,2,put Kelly on too .,5
but I ..,3,shut up . don't fall apart . the only people who can blow this is us . remember ?,19
"yeah , right .",4,"good . just keep telling yourselves that , the only people who can fuck this up is us .",19
"I was worried about you , Suzie . I decided we should all get together , one more time , before we split up .",25,are you mad at me ?,6
that was about as grim as it gets .,9,the guy was history when he killed Kelly . you knew that .,13
but then you knew what he was like all along ... Maybe his killing Kelly was a thing you had counted on ...,23,"but then it is better this way , don't you think ? no loose ends .",16
what ?,2,that was the same thing Ray said .,8
seems to like some of the same places you do . funny you never met .,16,"yeah , real funny . you're wrong about this , I could get busted on the spot .",18
"I've seen you out there in your old air boat , thinking about what might have been , old man Van Ryan hadn't fucked you out of it . what if I told you I had a way we could get a big piece of it back ?",48,we ?,2
how ...,2,"Walter . he's been aimin' that Brownie through knotholes for years . I saw these , I knew he'd finally struck gold . I can't decide which came out better , that little straw Kelly's got up her nose , or that vibrator you've got up her ass . what do you think , Mr. Lombardo ?",57
"why don't you tell us one more time , how Kelly came to be with you , alone in your house .",22,"story's the same , Detective ...",6
I had to go look for this coupon .,9,the one you bought at school .,7
"like I said , I hadn't really expected to use it . anyway , I'm going through a drawer . I hear a car . I look out the window . I see Nicole driving away . I leave my room , and there's Kelly .",46,"in cutoffs , a wet T-shirt .",7
yes .,2,and she wanted to talk .,6
yes .,2,but you can't tell us what she wanted to talk about .,12
"I could , but it's confidential . look , the point is , we didn't talk . I told her this was not an appropriate time or place .",29,and she began to cry . and you put an arm around her .,14
but she ran away .,5,that's right .,3
"but you do admit to touching her , to putting your arm around her . isn't that against the rules ?",21,"it is and I don't . ordinarily ... But , I mean ... there's this kid standing in front of you crying ...",23
with a thirty-five inch bustline in a wet T-shirt with no bra ...,13,fuck you . this is bullshit . I'm outta here .,11
"yeah , well , you fixed that . what the hell happened , anyway ?",15,"the bitch shot me , is what happened .",9
"hey , what did you want me to do , die ?",12,"well , shit , you're the cop , they don't teach you to disarm people , shoot them in the leg or something ? you weren't supposed to kill her for Christ's sake .",34
"did you become squeamish about these things before or after you bludgeoned little Suzie Toller to death with a wine bottle ? Jesus , man . it couldn't have worked out better . they're convinced Kelly whacked Suzie . I can't talk' em out of it . we should be celebrating . this thing worked out just like you said , only better .",64,"Kelly was supposed to be framed , not killed . what I'm telling you is , I don't like surprises .",21
you mean this thing ?,5,"yes , we call it a winch . and these are shrouds , and these are stays .",18
I thought this was supposed to be a vacation . why didn't you buy a nice big power boat ?,20,"come on , man . I'll make a sailor out of you yet .",14
"yeah , or get me drowned .",7,"Jesus , man ... You okay ?",7
"that how you planned it ? you take cut Suzie , get me to hang it on Kelly , then dump me in the ocean ...",26,"come off it , man ... It was an accident .",11
"meet my partner , Gloria Perez .",7,I did . at Blue balls .,7
it's Celine . he's okay . he had a pretty good line on what cheap fucks people are .,19,"so Suzie , you called us , remember ?",9
no .,2,will they ?,3
it doesn't look like it .,6,then he'll be back at Blue balls ?,8
"you ought to watch it with that shit , Suzie . you get busted again , you go back in a two-tine loser .",24,you got something against cigarettes ?,6
that's cop bullshit .,4,"well , you're half right . best thing you could do for yourself right now would be to talk to me .",22
about what ?,3,every triangle I've ever seen never lasts . somebody's got to go .,13
is this supposed to mean something to me ? what triangle ?,12,"you , Kelly , Sam .",6
I don't have to listen to this . and you can't shove me around . I have friends now ...,20,is that what you think ? you have friends ? is that what they told you ?,17
I don't mean who you're thinking . I have other friends ...,12,"Suzie , Suzie ... This is me , Ray , you're talking to . we both know you don't have shit , never have had shit , never will have shit ...",32
get away from me .,5,"don't you see what this means ? you really think Sam and Kelly are gonna give you a third of the money ? you , the pill-head with the rap sheet ?",32
Davy .,2,that's right . that was his name .,8
you ... I should've killed you myself. should never have left it up to him ...,16,"shoulda , coulda , woulda ... Get him in the water .",12
"Sam , for godsake .",5,"hey , Ray . guess whose name is on the numbered bank account besides yours and Sam's ?",18
you're saying that Kelly was raped by Sam Lombardo .,10,that's right .,3
who is it ?,4,"detective Duquette , Ms. Van Ryan . let me in . now .",13
where is she ?,4,where she lives . in the guest house . now will you tell me what this is about ?,19
I'm placing your daughter under arrest .,7,you can't ...,3
but check this ...,4,Ken . I'm in some trouble . I need an attorney and you're the only one I know . so I figured I'd start here .,26
good thinking .,3,you can tie whoever did it to Sandra Van Ryan ...,11
forget it .,3,lady has some deep pockets . that's all I'm saying .,11
what's that supposed to mean ?,6,"for you to be getting this kind of heat , for what they have on you ... It doesn't add up . Sandra Van Ryan's got' em running scared . and I'll tell you something else , you rush , you get careless .",44
Nellie Gail Ranch ...,4,"sound nice ? it's a fucking drug rehab farm . it's where Kelly Van Ryan went when her morn fished her out of the swamp . meanwhile , you get educator of the year I mean there's no way they can put this thing in front of a jury . shit , they haven't even taken your statement yet . reason ? they're still shoveling dirt and my guess is , they're coming up empty . now tell me I'm right .",82
there's nothing for them to get .,7,"good . so what we're going to do is march right to Hunter's doorstep . we're going to insist they take a statement . we're going to tell them to charge your ass or get off your back . they're walking a fine line here . Defamation of character , malicious prosecution ...",53
I just want my life back ...,7,fair enough . let's go make a statement .,9
"come on , let loose !",6,I was just thinking about where I'm gonna stay . I lost the house . it's like waking up from a goddamn nightmare .,24
"you'll get over it . we've got a knockdown , airtight , motherfucker of a lawsuit against Sandra Van Ryan .",21,just like that ?,4
"just like that ? these people ruined your life , bro .",12,"okay , try me on Sunday . I'm going out to the Everglades on Saturday . you guys can wash the mud off .",24

"rules are rules , Mr. Lombardo .",7,all right . I'll have to look for it .,10
Kelly ...,2,drop dead ... You know where my mom is trying to get the money to pay you off ? she's trying to break my trust . how do you like that ? I can't touch it until she's dead and she won't give me a dime and now she's trying to break it to pay you ...,57
how much ?,3,about six and a half million dollars .,8
"God , you scared the shit out of me . you must be crazy coming here .",17,of course I'm crazy . ask my mom .,9
"the only way we're gonna blow this now , is if we do it ourselves ...",16,do it to ourselves ?,5
we have to stick with the plan .,8,stick ?,2
Kelly . is Suzie there ?,6,yes .,2
shit . I was afraid of that . she left this garbled message on my machine . can you calm her down ?,23,why can't you come ...,5
you know what it takes .,6,then do it . I need you on this Kelly . do it tonight . we'll figure something out ... Okay ?,22
I'm here .,3,"okay . I want you to hear this too . we've got to be cool . all of us . people think I'm rich , for Christ's sake . I'm doing what rich guys do . I'm spending my money . it's more suspicious if I sit around doing nothing . now don't let this cop fuck with your minds .",61
"I'm sorry , Kelly . I'm sorry it had to happen like this . she was losing it ...",19,there was no way . that cop would've gotten her to tell him ... everything . she was weak and dumb ...,22
hello ?,2,hello .,2
Duquette . forget him ...,5,I can't help it . he gives me the creeps ... I mean why was Suzie so scared of him ? she's not that way . I think he did something ...,32
"yeah , he got her busted for possession ...",9,I don't know ... I think it was something else ... Suzie says the bust was bullshit ...,18
and you believe her ?,5,I don't know . I want to see you ...,10
Kelly ... Relax . take one of your mom's Valium or something . in another week you get on the plane . it's over . we're rich .,28,"but what if they find out ... God , they'd put you in the gas chamber ...",17
"so if they're tapping your phone , we're dead . stay in the guest house . skip the graduation parties . you'll never see Duquette . okay ? I love you .",32,okay . I love you too .,7
that never seemed to worry you at the Glades .,10,that's not your line .,5
I love you . now give me the line .,10,no little girl can ever make me come .,9
I'm running away .,4,you think that's wise ?,5
is that Sam Lombardo ?,5,"hi , Mon .",4
"which one of your "" bodyguards "" is that ?",10,Whichever one I want .,5
"okay , what's the matter ?",6,you notice my new jumper ?,6
"my friends buy me clothes , so I don't look like trash .",13,I would hardly say you look like trash .,9

will you calm down . Duquette's gonna come to you just like he did to me . you're gonna have to be ready for him .,26,"yeah , but he can't push you around like he can me . you've got family and they've got clout . with we it's different ... with me ...",29
"yeah , I've got family and they've got clout and now you have me . right ? and Sam . believe me , Suzie , this dickhead's not going to send you anywhere . he's gonna try and rattle your cage , and that's it . stay strong and he can't do shit .",54,"man , I wanna smoke a joint .",8

"come on . beats study hall , doesn't it ?",10,no !,2
"thank you , Jimmy .",5,"hey , man , at least in study hail I could meditate .",13

Ms. Toller ?,3,I said he did .,5
"Ms. Toller . I'm asking you now , under oath , did Samuel Lonbardo rape you ?",17,this wasn't my idea .,5
I'm sorry ?,3,"he was my friend at first . then I got busted ... he didn't even stick up for me . I had to go away to that hellhole . it's like , you're his favorite , then who cares ? you wanna know something ? when Kelly said we should do this , I thought cool , all these big shots screwing me over , like that cop , Duquette . now they're gonna get screwed .",77
"the line I get on this guy , is that he's done half the women in Blue Bay .",19,"not that stuff about her running away , him trying to find her . that's bullshit .",17
what about witnesses ?,4,"we've got three . guy mowing his yard , couple of kids playing hoops .",15
"are you crazy , Ray ?",6,"you heard Kelly say "" Sam . "" that was Lombardo on the phone . and you saw the girls ...",21
"Ray . the conversation on this tape is totally unintelligible . what we have here , is you on the Van Ryan property , without a proper warrant , shooting a porn flick ...",34,"I don't believe I'm hearing this . a month ago you were pulling these two apart at the courthouse . they were acting . they were all acting , from the beginning . and we bought it , hook , line and sinker ... And now they're home free with six million of Sandra Van Ryan's money .",58
"oh , Ray ... no ...",6,"you think this is just about money , about us looking foolish ? question him . you're gonna find a stone cold manipulative psychopath . and those girls are going to wind up dead ...",35
"Kelly's next , Gloria .",5,"get off this Ray , now . if there is any evidence here , it's for Homicide . you get an ID , you call me .",27
"I fucked up . I lost control of the situation , the one thing they train you for ... God , what did I do ?",26,just tell us what happened .,6
she bit you ?,4,"bit , scratched . but I had her pinned . she calmed down . I was going to cuff her ... She said she thought she was going to be sick . she asked to use the bathroom .",39
"I told her I was coming with her . she nodded , like she understood . we stood up together .",21,you didn't cuff her ?,5
"the teeth , were they ...",6,Suzie Toller's . and that's the only thing saving your sorry ass .,13
why ?,2,I think she's acting . I think she set it up to be alone with him because she wanted him to come on to her . I think maybe she's upset that he didn't ...,35
that doesn't make him a child rapist . there's something else . this girl's had some problems . wrecked a couple of her mom's cars . ran away ...,29,where's this coming from ?,5
I want a full-scale investigation .,6,you know what that will mean for Lombardo .,9
that bothers you ?,4,"yeah , maybe , a little .",7
you didn't tell me you were gonna put me on the fucking news .,14,"we need to tape the interview , Suzie . no one will see it but us . now when was this , that Mr. Lombardo gave you the ride ?",30
he dropped Jimmy off first ?,6,yeah .,2
"and when he arrived at your house , was anyone there ?",12,no .,2
so you were alone .,5,yes .,2
did he come in with you ?,7,I guess .,3
at that point were you able to fight him off ?,11,no . he stopped by himself . okay ? that's all . let me go .,16
he did say something .,5,what was that ?,4
I've got that two o'clock in town .,8,back to the land of grownups .,7
that would make it about the time of her old man's suicide . you don't think that could explain some erratic behavior ?,23,"all I'm saying is , I think we should go slow here .",13
"it's our job , Gloria .",6,hunter's making it our job because Sandra Van Ryan's got a bug up his ass . you know that as well as I do . we're gonna trash this guy's life and I keep asking myself if it's really necessary .,41
same as him . they saw her come . they saw her go . they saw him follow .,19,still doesn't explain why he couldn't catch up with her . I mean how long does it take to put on a shirt ?,24
"we failed to mention the mower guy's a drunk , that he was after more beer and never really saw Kelly go into the house , so he can't say how long she was in there . same with the kids . they saw her running down the street , but that's it . with no physical evidence , what do we have ? her word against his .",69,you're telling me you believe the guy ?,8
you can go up to one of those trees and peel the bark . you know what you get ? more bark . and more bark . there's no core . tree's not good tar anything but sucking up water . and now they can't get rid of them . they've tried poisons . nothing works . they don't die .,61,"yeah , well , Van Ryan got his . I don't imagine he gives a shit now .",18
the skinny brunette .,4,this is where she lives . she wants to talk . beats the shit out of me why she would call me at all . I busted her once for possession. she wound up doing about six months at Camp Nine .,42
you saw the news today ?,6,Lombardo's settlement ?,3
"think back , before the suit was filed , before the trial . Lombardo had an affair with Sandra , right ? so why not tell us about the affair ? I mean it could be a hell of a motive for Kelly to fabricate her charge in the first place .",52,maybe Lombardo's attorney was saving the affair for the trial .,11
"I thought of that . then I said , come on , you're Lombardo . your reputation is getting trashed . you want to stop the bleeding . you don't want to sit in jail for three months . unless ...",41,unless what ?,3
"why ? you ask me , Lombardo had it pretty good already , nice job in a beautiful setting , popular , an active social life . he's gonna put this all on the line for some dicey play like what you're describing ...",44,the job looks okay to us . but look at it from his point of view . the man's surrounded by wealth and privilege . but for him ... it's just a reminder of what should have been his .,40
"her father didn't leave her squat . the kid's got money in trust from her grandfather , but she can't touch that till her mother dies and Sandra seems to have the idea that Kelly ought to learn the value of a buck .",44,"this one's got you working overtime , hasn't it ?",10
"I flat don't like the guy , glory . he's dirty . and I'll tell you something else . you want to know how old man Lombardo lost his money ? he was fucked out of it by old man Van Ryan , on a little item known as the Salt Creek Land deal . it was after the war . van Ryan set up a corporation to develop swamp land , got investors like Lombardo to put up money , then turned around and got the state to declare the area an ecological preserve , on the sly , of course , but everyone knew it was him . the freeway went to the coast , right where Van Ryan wanted it .",124,eliminate the competition .,4
you got it . the rich got richer . while the saps like Lombardo went belly-up in the swamp .,20,"where'd you come up with this stuff , anyway ?",10
I net a guy in a bar .,8,"which she might have saved , if she hadn't set out to destroy the man's life .",17
guess I kind of lost it there .,8,you could say that .,5
were you ever in a situation where you could see a thing coming and you didn't do what you could to stop it ?,24,we all have ...,4
Ray . we don't know anything yet . she could be anywhere ...,13,I'm gonna take you back to the office . will you put out a call on Suzie's car for me ?,21
just check out the car .,6,"two kids could've gotten into a fight , lost a couple of teeth .",14
those are Suzie Toller's teeth .,6,where's the body ?,4
"the swamp , most likely ... Lombardo's a swamp rat , knows the body will never be found there . but he's made a mistake .",26,her grandmother said she'd been threatening to run away . and I found the car at the Miami bus terminal .,21
"poor dumb Suzie , she never had a chance .",10,"we don't know that , Ray ...",7
will you do me one favor ?,7,"Ray , you heard him ...",6
and if the teeth aren't Suzie's ? you'll give this up ?,12,if I'm wrong about those teeth -- it's a promise .,11
"I'm tired , Ray . I'm going home .",9,where's Lombardo ?,3
he's leaving the country . and I don't give a shit .,12,the blood type on the rocks matches Suzie's .,9
"it's Homicide's job now , Ray , let' em do it . I'll tell you something else , there's more to this story than you know , Ray ... If Suzie is dead , I think Hunter may be on the right track ...",44,"if old pictures interest you , come back some time , there's quite a collection down in the pagoda . I'll see you get a proper tour .",28
did you call anyone ? did you call her house to see if she got home ? did you call the Masons ?,23,no .,2
Suzie Toller is missing .,5,how long ?,3
"she didn't cone home last night . we found her car at the bus terminal , but nothing to suggest she bought a ticket .",25,maybe she used another name .,6
Ray thinks she was murdered .,6,I don't know what to say ...,7
"Kelly's file . read it . you're going to find an angry , sexually confused girl who's made threats on her mother's life and a female lover she'd never identify .",31,Suzie ?,2
"how are you , Kelly ? would you like to take a break for a minute ?",17,I just want to get it over with . my mom's making me do this . I just want to forget it .,23
"the next thing ... his hand was in my shorts ... you know , from behind . his fingers ... his fingers ...",23,take your time .,4
I understand .,3,"he said something like , "" Do you want it dirty7 "" or something . I tried to turn away , but he pushed me to the floor .",29
was there penetration ? did he put himself inside you ?,11,yes . I said stop . I screamed . I mean that's how it sounded in my head . he hurt me ...,23
"that's okay , Kelly . you're doing fine . but I have to ask you something here . when you say it hurt . was this the first time a man was inside you ?",35,"no . I've done it a couple of times , I mean with guys I dated . but this hurt ... like , he was built ... you know ...",30
I ... he had my wrists pinned behind me . I remember my hands were cold .',17,then what ?,3
"he kept saying , "" Let it happen , let it happen . "" then he just stopped .",19,you mean he withdrew ...,5
"not at first . he was still inside but he wasn't moving or anything ... He said we had this secret . and that now he'd be able to help me ... because we were close ... Something like that . I don't know . it's hard to remember , exactly .",52,"try , Kelly .",4
Gator can't see what's in front of it for shit . they see out the sides . that one don't even know Walter's arm's in his mouth .,28,what if something distracts it and it snaps anyway ?,10
I was wondering if I could ask you a few questions .,12,about Suzie ?,3
"actually , I was wondering if I might ask you about Ray Duquette .",14,he used to come around here . he had a thing going with one of the girls over at the Glades .,22
"got sort of hung up on her , from what hear .",12,she still work there ?,5
"no . not after that night . I don't know what happened . maybe he caught her with some john ... All I know is , the next morning the girl was gone and there was a dead boy ... Indian kid named Davy . used to live down the road there in a wrecked car . him and Suzie were at the Glades that night . it was right after that , Ray got Suzie busted and sent her away . that's what there is to say about Ray Duquette .",92,was there ever any kind of investigation ...,8
"wasn't enough Van Ryan had to destroy the people who invested here . he got to be old , he and his rich cronies would come down here , hunt and whore , act like assholes . one trip he showed up with this young girl he'd picked up somewhere , gotten her pregnant then dumped her in the swamp . that came with her .",66,and the child ...,4
"she had it , before she drank herself to death . wasn't exactly a love child ...",17,Suzie . then you're not her grandmother ...,8
"raised her like she was , but no , Walter's my only child . he was a good boy , till the army took him .",26,so Suzie and Sandra Van Ryan were half- sisters .,10
you okay ?,3,I'm fine . nice TV .,6
how soon can we get something ?,7,"we can get blood type right away . dental records will take longer . you want DNA , that can take weeks .",23
"Merritt , forensics .",4,the teeth doin' any talkin' ?,6
Ray . stop calling . I told you the dental records will take time ...,15,what about the blood ?,5
could be hers . types match . could be a lot of other people's too ...,16,"second you get something on those teeth , I want it",11
not that I'm going to be much good after last night ...,12,eat a power bar .,5
is that Sandra Van Ryan's kid ?,7,Kelly .,2
she's going to wash your Jeep ?,7,"senior class fund-raising gig . I told' em they could hose down the Jeep . hey , come on . it's for a good cause .",26
you look pretty .,4,thanks .,2
"hey , I've got it , I may as well spend it , right ? I've always wanted to live where I could dive for my dinner .",28,and where might that be ?,6
"I was thinking , Antigua , maybe .",8,I love Antigua . maybe I'll come visit you .,10
talk to me Artie .,5,Kelly Van Ryan ...,4
... is accusing me of rape . Jimmy told me . apparently I'm the last to know ...,18,Sam ... I ... Sandra Van Ryan's been on the horn with every member of the school board all day long . she's pushing for suspension ...,27
"all I can tell you Sam , is hang in there . they clear you of this mess , you get reinstated , with back pay ...",27,that's great . I'll just tell my creditors I'm not a rapist . no problem ... Shit . I can't believe the board's going to act without even hearing my side of it .,34
"in a hurry , are we ?",7,I was in the middle of a melodramatic exit . it wouldn't really make a statement if I tiptoed out the door ... What are you selling ?,28
bad news .,3,people pay good money for that ?,7
I'm just a messenger .,5,oh no . no way . I've had all the bad news I can take for one day .,19
my parents ? what do you mean ?,8,I'm terrible at this . I blurt . I'm a blurter . your parents ... They ... well ... they exist no further . Skinny-dipping . the Amazon . Piranhas . it wasn't pretty .,35
you've got the wrong guy . the closest my parents have been to the Amazon is the Brazilian Pavilion at Epcot .,22,"well kid , I'm speaking of ... your biological parents .",11
how quaint .,3,it's spring break . I don't want to go to a will reading .,14
"are you familiar with "" Heaven ? """,8,I'm seventeen . I know it like the back of my hand .,13
"your fathered owned the entire "" Heaven "" empire . you own it now . any questions ?",18,"smashing ! welcome to the family , Ted . you are going to breathe some new life into this place . you are going to set the world on fire ! you are going to ... call me Uncle Billy ? please ?",43
"uh , sure . Uncle Billy .",7,I have only one concern ...,6
of course I like girls .,6,"a lot ? I mean , a whole lot ?",10
as much as possible .,5,you're sure ?,3
the parties are held in here when the weather dips below seventy . which is seldom .,17,seldom ? no kidding ?,5
"ah , in other words , this is the apres-orgy salon ?",12,"indeed it is . during the day , visitors prefer to be outside , au naturel . as it were .",21
"maybe she needs help , Ted . you should be a gentleman .",13,I ... uh ... I think she's doing fine on her own .,13
"there you are , Ted-baby . everything all right ?",10,yeah . everything's cool .,5
you ready for your big coming out party ? everybody's dying to meet you .,15,just a couple of finishing touches . my parents always said you never get a second chance to make a good first impression .,24
"they said that ? really ? oh , your parents . the Nelson's . right , right . how Midwest . I like that .",25,"truth is , I'm a little nervous .",8
all those people out there . it's a lot of pressure .,12,huh ! you laugh in the face of pressure !,10
I do ?,3,you are a multi-media magnate . the Tycoon of Tits . the Baron of Bottoms .,16
you're the Sultan of semen . the Monarch of masturbation . the merchant Prince of lust . you . Ted . are the King of coitus .,27,me ? the King of coitus ?,7
the Supreme sovereign of Sexuality .,6,whoa . but ... that's the thing ... I've never even actually ...,13
I told you you could do it .,8,I was like a different person tonight .,8
you were the new and improved you .,8,I would have been laughed right out of Xenia .,10
"no one will be laughing at you now , Ted . you can take that to the bank .",19,it's really going to be strange going home in a couple of days .,14
"you ARE home . but go ahead , finish school , do what you feel you need to do . in the meantime , I'll be your point person here on the magazine .",34,really ? you'd do that for me ?,8
"I've been very lazy for a long , long time .",11,"you seem like you're anything but lazy , Uncle Billy .",11
I never finished school myself . never had to . my brother built this empire from nothing but his wife's perky tits and a whole lot of gumption . he gave me a cushy job on a silver platter . I never struggled for a second .,47,my parents always say hard work builds character .,9
"it's not like I didn't have ideas , I had plenty of ideas . but I never even shared them with your father . never had the guts .",29,what kind of ideas ?,5
"well ... for one thing ... I think it's despicable that we exclude so many women that only fit our western notion of "" classic beauty . """,28,you think we should be more open minded ?,9
"the world is a big , beautiful place . we can open new markets in Africa and Asia . imagine the Dali Lhama reading our magazine .",27,"in other words , our scope is too narrow .",10
"at our press conference tomorrow , I think we should announce our plans to explore the world . not just a few leggy 36D's , with blond hair upstairs and down .",32,that's perfect .,3
don't forget to tell them all your qualifications .,9,"I'm Ted Nelson . I guess you already know that part . for two years I've been the editor of the high school paper in Xenia , Ohio . I've won some awards , made a difference . I've always had journalism in my soul . now I know why .",51
"so far , so good . some of them have real Angel potential .",14,really ? so I'm doing OK ?,7
my father must've been amazing .,6,he was in a league of his own .,9
I never saw anybody turn so many shades of red .,11,I can't wait to see the pictures .,8
"it was incredible . the light , the crowd , everything .",12,such enthusiasm . have I told you lately how proud I am of you ?,15
seriously ? I'm doing all right ?,7,"you're taking this bull of an empire by the horns , but you're still keeping your small town values . you're not letting all this "" stuff "" spoil you .",31
I owe it all to you . without your help I'd be lost .,14,"I wish I knew you years ago , when my brother was alive . I wish he never gave you up .",22
"I'd love to , but I really need to crack the books . final exams are coming up and I've been slacking .",23,"you're right . I should work , too . our first issue together is almost ready to print .",19
"thanks , Uncle Billy . thanks for everything .",9,you're a great kid . don't you forget it .,10
yes ?,2,"we've got a huge problem with the magazine , Ted-baby . our readers hate it . hate IT . we need to talk .",24
"I loved my brother . I stood by his wishes to let his son run the company . a son he never knew . a son that he and his wife gave away at birth . a son who was raised in a world quite different from our own . nevertheless , I was there for the lad . I guided him as best I could . but he's only seventeen , with a mind of his own and judgment that is , well , frankly , not a chip off the old block . there is only one clear solution ... And I think we all know what that is--",111,--PEACHES ! canned peaches !,5
what are you doing ?,5,"my job . back off , Benedict .",8
"thanks for teaching me an important lesson . what makes a family is love , not blood .",18,"all is fair in "" Heaven , "" Ted-baby .",10
that's right . and guess who's the new King of the unemployment Line .,14,"aw , come on , kid . throw me a bone . I'm your uncle for gosh sakes .",19
"I like you , Ted . you know that . I liked you before you were filthy rich .",19,"thanks , Principal Merkin .",5
I'll be blunt . I know you can take it .,11,"yes , sir . I'll brace myself .",8
"Ted , you are the best editor this school paper ever had . you don't need to be pandering flesh . it's nonsense . it's beneath you .",28,you think I ought to just tell them thanks but no thanks ? I don't want your silly billion dollar empire ?,22
"that's a good start , yes . a very good start .",12,"are you kidding ? this magazine is my dream . it's every red-blooded , heterosexual male's dream .",18
"have you ever even looked at "" Heaven ? """,10,"what kind of sick question is that ? I'll be watching you , young man . your money and power mean nothing here . nothing .",26
"with all due respect to Merk , he doesn't have to read my magazine . but he has no right to stop others . ever hear of the First Amendment ?",31,we cannot afford free speech if it excises the moral fiber of this community !,15
"honestly , Merk . it's like you were never seventeen and the head of a media empire .",18,rules are rules .,4
"come on , it's our only senior prom .",9,"deaf ears , Mr. Nelson . I answer to a higher power .",13
"you're crossing the line , Mr. Nelson .",8,"a statue in front of city hall , dedicated to Principal Dick Merkin ?",14
I'm warning you .,4,a new pediatric wing at the hospital ? a presidential campaign ? name it . anything .,17
"you kicked us off your turf , Merk . don't rain on our parade .",15,"Mr. Nelson , you disappoint me . first you break our school board rules . then you break the law .",21
"what law , Merk ? having fun ? letting down our hair on prom night ?",16,our state has a zero tolerance policy for underage drinking .,11
you called the cops on us ?,7,alcohol does horrible things to a developing young mind .,10
what is this ? does everybody know everything I'm about to say or do every freakin' minute of the day ?,21,"no cursing in this house , young man . use the strong vocabulary God gave you .",17
what about Charlie ? you boys could make it a little adventure .,13,"Charlie , at a will reading ? what did I do to deserve this ?",15
"I'm all right , Mom . I'm not in Siberia , you know .",14,did you have a nice flight ? are they taking good care of you ?,15
"yeah , I'm doing fine . I have so much to tell you . I don't even know where to begin .",22,"save it , honey . we want to hear every detail when you get back , but we don't want you to run up Mr. Zukerman's phone bill .",29
well ? surprised ?,4,what is all this ? when are you coming home ?,11
"just a few tokens of my affection . I'll be back soon , don't worry .",16,"everything is lovely , Ted , but much too expensive .",11
"oh , good lord . are those Neptunes ?",9,only the best for my mother .,7
you promise you'll finish school ?,6,I'll make you very proud .,6
you don't have to work another day in your lives .,11,but how would we pay our bills ?,8
don't you get it ? in one day I earn more interest than the store's entire annual revenue .,19,oh . goodness .,4
you're free . you can do anything you ever wanted to do !,13,like what ?,3
but who would run the store ?,7,forget the store . think big .,7
everything I am is because of you . can you ever forgive me ?,14,"oh , Teddy . we missed you so much .",10
"so , William Randolph . your last big scoop contrasted the popularity of Rice Crispie treats and chocolate Snickerdoodles at the annual bake sale .",25,that's just one example . my reporting has made a difference .,12
the school dumpsters used to overflow to the point where the stench was unbearable . my award winning exposé changed all that . the city added an extra weekday trash pick-up .,32,is it true ? is ignorance bliss ?,8
"look , I loved "" exposed ! "" and I hate it that you got busted . I know the school paper sucks in comparison , but it's really not THAT BAD .",33,don't even tell me you're hot for Miss titty Pom Poms over there .,14
Christy's a very talented journalist . I see a Pulitzer in her future .,14,I didn't know they gave them for Best Lip gloss Retention during a Blow Job .,16
Me-ow .,2,go ahead . ask her to the prom . get it over with .,14
I have absolutely no intention--,5,--Do it . I triple-dog-dare you .,7
"I tried to warn you , William Randolph . she's got stiletto heels hidden in those Keds .",18,but you triple-dog-dared me .,5
"it's so nice to have friends like you , Christy .",11,"what is it , William Randolph ? your balls need scratching ?",12
your article sucked .,4,in what sense ?,4
"in the sense that there is no "" hidden agenda "" behind a bake sale that raised five hundred dollars for seeing eye dogs .",25,"ah ha ! it was so well hidden , you didn't even know it was there .",17
"come on , Julie . don't screw up . you have some real talent .",15,just because someone died and made you king of the publishing world doesn't mean you're even one ounce smarter than you were a week ago .,26
I'm trying to help .,5,I'm still better than you . nothing changed except the decimal point in your savings account .,17
what do you want from me ? I'm trying to be fair . but I can't keep you on staff if you turn every PTA meeting into an Agent Orange cover up .,33,then I'll write about YOU .,6
me ?,2,""" local boy inherits more money than god . "" call me crazy , but I smell human interest .",20
different how ? different like a dwarf at a basketball game ? or different like a lesbian in pumps ?,20,I don't get the distinction .,6
"could everybody else tell you were different , or were you the only one who knew ?",17,I felt limited . I felt confined . I felt like I was suffocating .,15
I see . so more like a tight rope Walker who secretly wants to be a trapeze artist .,19,I guess .,3
"she said peanuts , you cretin .",7,you never know around here .,6
don't write that part .,5,is this an gritty exposé or a candy ass press release ?,12
write what you want . just try not to make it so obvious that you're crazy about me .,19,life must be peachy on Planet Ted .,8
I did my homework . your grandfather was a peach farmer .,12,my adoptive grandfather . who knows what my biological grandfather did .,12
undoubtedly an aristocratic bartender of some sort .,8,"considering this is your first time on a private jet , on which you are interviewing the world's most eligible bachelor , you are extremely cavalier .",27
I bet there are lots and lots of mirrors on Planet Ted .,13,"see ? you're impertinent , rude , sarcastic .",9
"and this is not my first time on a private jet , so quit acting like I'm Rebecca of Sunnybrook Farm .",22,"a little respect would be nice , that's all .",10
well ? what do you think of her ?,9,you're so twitterpated you don't even see the miner's hat and the pickax .,14
why can't you be nice to me ?,8,you've got enough people kissing your ass .,8
wow ... you clean up nice .,7,"put your eyeballs back in your head , William Randolph . I'm on assignment . a girl has to fit in .",22
where are we going ?,5,to the best hiding place in the world .,9
I can't believe your dad built this for you .,10,he didn't . he had it built .,8
whatever .,2,"not "" whatever . "" it's two different things .",10
he cared enough to want you to have it .,10,he phoned it in .,5
I doubt it .,4,"now it makes sense , the whole Neo Bohemian , down with hypocrisy , fight the power crap . you're a poor little rich girl .",26
the ozone must be fully depleted on Planet Ted .,10,"you think my dad would have been like that if I knew him ? you think he would have bought me a stadium , instead of teaching me how to play ball ?",33
your dad taught you everything .,6,I mean my father .,5
"a father is nothing but sperm , Ted . it takes a real man to be a dad .",19,it's all so complicated .,5
it's incredibly simple .,4,I feel like I'm being drawn and quartered . like every part of me is being pushed and pulled and tugged in a different direction .,26
eventually you'll let go .,5,and then what ?,4
then you'll see who's really holding on to you .,10,you're amazing .,3
I know .,3,"even when you infuriate me , I still want to kiss you .",13
but you never do .,5,"if we were a team , we could do anything . I mean , anything .",16
"cut to the chase , William Randolph . your audience is way ahead of you .",16,in a word : MERK . exposed .,8
"that's two words . and I'm out of the "" exposed "" business , remember ? I need to graduate . besides , Merk's a boy scout .",28,there's gotta be something . we have to dig deeper .,11
"you forget , I dislike YOU at least as much as him .",13,he shut down your paper ! you're stuck writing articles about swap meets and raffles and PTA brunches !,19
a good journalist can take lemons and make lemonade . I'm honing my craft .,15,then you won't mind covering that watermelon seed spitting contest next week ...,13
that's probably my office .,5,well ? where the hell are you ?,8
I got an anonymous tip and an address in Cincinnati .,11,let's do it .,4
I don't know . this place seems pretty tame .,10,"you expected whips , chains , Merk being cattle-prodded by some dominatrix in a leather hood ?",17
at least it's not another 4-H meeting or a Big Brother barbecue .,13,amen to that .,4
"look at us . it's one o'clock in the morning , on a school night . we're in a smoky nightclub , hoping to catch our principal with some big city tart .",33,I'm trembling with excitement .,5
that has more to do with your proximity to me .,11,"my desire betrays me , like goosebumps on my flesh .",11
I have a bit of a goosebump fetish . not many people know that .,15,I figured you for more of a hairy armpit guy .,11
"shoes , if you want to know the truth . shoes are my thing .",15,wearing them ? or humping them ?,7
"my fantasy is a totally naked woman , wearing nothing but a Timex and suede clogs .",17,that's refreshingly deviant .,4
what about you ?,4,I'm very aural .,4
tell me more .,4,"sounds , voices , music , humming . all of it can turn me on , or off , like a switch .",23
I see .,3,I had a Portuguese boyfriend who could read the phone book and melt me .,15
"a Portuguese boyfriend . sounds very "" Cosmo . """,10,"you live and learn . I realized the most important thing to me , above all , is trust .",20
"turned out to be a scoundrel , eh ? I saw that one coming .",15,"you lose trust in someone and it's over , done , gone , forever .",15
"do you trust me , Julie ?",7,not a chance .,4
come on .,3,"trust is something you earn , over time . you don't just inherit it overnight like a gazillion dollar empire .",21
I want you to trust me .,7,maybe someday .,3
"Julie , I'll tell you something that is the god's honest truth . I've seen a lot of really beautiful girls . I mean a lot . but none of them make me feel like you do .",38,that's hard to believe .,5
"I have to be honest with you , Ted . I really despise "" The Girls of Xenia . """,20,"I know , their small town mentality can be maddening .",11
"I mean your pictorial . it bothers me , profoundly .",11,"aw Julie , it's my job . it's like being a doctor .",13
you're telling me you don't get aroused by a roomful of naked breasts .,14,"you've seen one naked breast , you've seem them all .",11
"which explains the continued success of "" Heaven "" for how many decades ?",14,you're quick . I like that .,7
you think you're working with chimps here ?,8,"the thing is , I made a commitment . I said I'd do it and I have to keep my word .",22
"Julie , wow . I was afraid you left . I was afraid I'd never see you again .",19,"I'm not going anywhere , Ted . you're the one with the champagne wishes and caviar dreams .",18
very ambitious . I like that .,7,"the thing is , I'll need a first mate .",10
"I graduated from college . did great , summa cum laude and all . and I'm about to launch a brand new magazine called "" exposed ! "" an homage to Miss Julie Conroy of Xenia , Ohio .",39,I know where you can find an excellent editor-in-chief .,10
yellow pages ?,3,let your fingers do the walking .,7
they're playing our song . dare I ask for this dance ?,12,you better .,3
"Mom , Dad . meatloaf has come to represent all that Ted hates about his mediocre life and the world we live in . he's what you'd call clinically bummed .",31,"why can't we have pot roast or stroganoff or even a little London broil ? I mean , for god's sake , we own a grocery store !",28
"James , what are you doing here ?",8,you can call me Jimmy again . Sheryl Petersen said James sounds too pretentious .,15
"Sheryl Petersen is , what , nine years old , what does she know ?",15,"she knew exactly where you were staying , which you neglected to tell me , your own brother .",19
impressive . this is bigger than our whole house .,10,"most places are , Jimmy .",6
they say money can't buy happiness but this is a reasonably good facsimile .,14,"so , what brings you here at his hour ?",10
my new bike .,4,very funny .,3
I came to ask permission to take custody of your room .,12,my room ?,3
"better view , more spacious , new carpet . it's a no-brainer .",13,it's not up to me .,6
Mom and Dad said it's yours . they seem to think you're coming home .,15,"you can have it , then . I'm not going back there .",13
if you could just sign right there .,8,you want it in writing ?,6
just a formality .,4,"that's it ? I mean , you don't want to order room service or anything ? we could play games and watch movies and stuff .",26
are you kidding ? Mom and Dad discover I'm gone and I'll be doing hard time .,17,are they okay ?,4
"aside from the fact that Mom's eyes are nearly swollen shut from crying and Dad spends all his time under the car trying to fix stuff that isn't broken , things couldn't be better .",35,"I miss them , too .",6
"you can't come back . that is , you can , but your things will be in the room you currently think of as mine .",26,you're a peach .,4
funny you should say that . my Grandfather was a peach farmer .,13,"he was my Grandfather , too .",7
I meant biologically .,4,that's a crappy thing to say .,7
I didn't forget .,4,"you ever look down on them again and call them "" grocers "" like it's a dirty word , and you'll be sucking your filet mignon through a straw for six to eight weeks . got it ?",38
great .,2,"from my wise , albeit youthful , vantage point , the world is your oyster . you scored big .",20
"how are the hometown folks treating you , back in Xenia ?",12,"well , Jay . they've been exceptionally supportive .",9
are they hitting you up for donations ? asking you to sponsor the local quilting bee ?,17,I'm no stranger to the notion of philanthropy . Andrew Carnegie has long been one of my idols .,19
"what about the future ? you planning to rock the boat at all ? stir things up in "" Heaven ? """,22,"matter of fact , Jay , my uncle and I are planning to rethink the magazine . to expand the traditional western notions of "" beauty . """,28
"no problem , consider it done . I had this idea of shooting on location . outdoors , you know ? maybe at some famous Xenia landmarks . you think that would be a problem ?",36,"we'll send you the release forms , Ted . our staffers will help in any way they can .",19
"it's a little more serious than that , Bill . the stockholders have requested a meeting . they want our guarantee that this will never happen again . some of them are even calling for Ted's resignation .",38,"look , the girls of Xenia are gorgeous , you'll see . next month we'll be back to normal .",20
"your parents never wanted to interfere with your life , Ted . they knew your Mom and Dad loved you very much . they knew they did the right thing . but that doesn't mean they didn't watch you and miss you , from afar .",46,you mean they knew who I was ?,8
"I wondered about them , for so many years . I wondered if I looked like them , acted like them . I wondered why they gave me up .",30,"giving you up was the most unselfish thing they ever did . when they founded "" Heaven , "" they wished they could take you back but it was too late . all they could do was build the empire , knowing that someday it would all be yours .",50
my legacy .,3,your parents would be crushed to think you weren't happy with it .,13
"they're not my parents , Helen . my parents are back in Xenia and I hurt them very much .",20,I understand .,3
"and the girl I love , she hates "" Heaven . "" if I keep it , she'll never respect me .",22,but how can you respect yourself if you don't ?,10
"but if you're watching this , then it means we bit the dust .",14,"but don't worry ... we'll be in heaven . the REAL heaven , I mean . not that heaven is an actual place , but more like a state of being . or not being . who knows . maybe we know now .",44
"if you're anything like yours truly , then you probably figure we didn't want you when you were born , so who cares if we're dead ? am I right ?",31,but we did want you . it's just that you don't always get to keep what you want . we knew you needed a real mom and dad .,29
we had no idea the nudie magazine we started in the garage would turn into all this .,18,can you believe that was me ?,7
"before we knew it , we created the most popular men's magazine in the entire nation . the rest is history .",22,"so here we are . dead . but we never want you to want for anything . that is , we want you to have everything .",27
I-I don't have the keys .,6,"they're in the ignition , silly .",7
you do know how to drive ?,7,I don't have much experience with a ... uh ... stick .,12
now release the brake . and slide the stick into first gear .,13,got it .,3
the first time can be awkward . you just have to get on and try again .,17,I don't even know if I should be doing this . it's a very expensive car .,17
it's your car . these are all your cars .,10,some of them have to be automatics .,8
"your father liked shifting . he said it brought him closer to the engine . "" like a woman , purring with ecstasy . """,25,"I'm Ted , by the way . I think I forgot to say that .",15
I know . I'm Ginger . Miss April .,9,the one with the horses .,6
that's me .,3,I almost didn't recognize you without ... you know ... that stallion between ... your ... uh ... legs .,20
"hey , Ted . wanna go shopping ?",8,"shopping , really ? I should tell my friend .",10
don't worry . he found the chocolate room .,9,"hi ho , Silver .",5
who exactly ARE you ?,5,what do you mean ? I'm Ted Nelson .,9
"or do you have a taste for the good life , Ted ? it's in your blood .",18,I always knew there was more . I felt it .,11
Teddy ? I was thinking .,6,hmmm ?,2
after graduation ... maybe we could go away together ?,10,whatever you want .,4
Ted ! do something !,5,what do you want me to do ?,8
this is humiliating . we're being ejected from a prom !,11,"hang in there , I'll think of something .",9
well ?,2,I guess ... I don't know ... I guess we should leave if we're not wanted .,17
"we understand your disappointment , Teddy . Christy is a pretty , sexy , provocative , voluptuous ... We ... uh ... we understand your disappointment .",27,it's my private business ! mine !,7
I remember spring break of my senior year . seems like a lifetime ago .,15,"Dad , please .",4
remember how you struggled through that whole facts of life talk and then found out I knew more than you ?,21,you're way ahead of me again ?,7
it was the year of the rhizopus rot . Grandpa almost lost the farm . you sacrificed your dream to go to the prize hog festival . and in the end you saved the peaches and you didn't have to slaughter your sow .,44,the lesson being ?,4
sometimes you have to do stuff you don't want to do . it's all part of growing up . and it usually works out peachy in the end .,29,I'm getting so good at this .,7
you guys are my parents .,6,of course we are .,5
they didn't want me when I was born . why should I care ...,14,son .,2
"well , why should I ?",6,"they had a rough life . your father was a bouncer . your mother was , well , a two-bit stripper . there was no place for a baby .",30
I guess .,3,they did do one great thing . they gave us our boy .,13
yeah .,2,be a sport . how bad could spring break in Los Angeles be ?,14
I guess we could go to Disneyland or something .,10,think of it as a rite of passage to manhood .,11
"like one of those "" National Geographic "" specials with the topless chicks ?",14,whatever helps you cope .,5
I guess it's better than having tribal patterns carved in my face .,13,"there ya go . always remember , focus on the peach ...",12
"Ted , it's your dad . I have a question for you . I don't know how to put it tactfully . you know I'm lousy with words .",29,"just say it , Dad .",6
"I know they were simple people , but did this trip help your college fund at all ?",18,"Dad , let's just say I can buy anything I want in the whole bookstore . including the bookstore .",20
"finally , some gratitude .",5,"we're grateful , Ted . it's not that . those craftsman tools ... they're a dream come true .",19
"but those are our dreams , son . we have to make them come true .",16,"consider me your fairy godfather , except without the fairy part . no more mealy apples and bruised bananas , ever , for the rest of your lives .",29
it's okay . you need me ?,7,your mom said you've been ignoring your chores .,9
I paid off the mortgage ! I ordered that Winnebago you always wanted ! now you're ashamed of me ?,20,you ordered a Winnebago ?,5
"that is your dream , not mine . my dream is so far beyond anything YOU PEOPLE could even imagine .",21,"watch your tone , mister .",6
"shut your pie hole , Jimmy .",7,I will not have my boys arguing .,8
we have a truckload of strawberries arriving on Tuesday morning .,11,we own a small family grocery store .,8
"we can't accept it . it's much too expensive . right , dear ?",14,"of course , dumpling . its very nice of Ted but ...",12
"sweetheart , what is it ?",6,I always wanted craftsman tools . he even got me the limited edition Buckeye colors .,16
we wanted you and Jimmy to have it someday . something real and honest .,15,we love our lives just the way they are .,10
"you have to understand . this was a big shock , for all of us . one minute you're our little boy , of whom we could not be more proud . the next minute you're the owner of this whole pornographic empire .",44,"but that doesn't make you the boss of everything , son .",12
"we're not ashamed of you , Teddy . we don't approve of the magazine or the models or the so-called "" flesh parties "" you attend . but we can get past all that .",35,we miss you . we miss our son .,9
we think you should give up the magazine . sell it . let someone else run it . whatever it takes .,22,"we want you to go to college , find a career you love , marry a nice girl from a nice family , and live happily ever after .",29
wouldn't it be awesome if we were about to say the exact same thing ?,15,"from your lips , to God's ears .",8
ladies first . I insist .,6,well . the prom's coming up .,7
yeah ?,2,and I was wondering .,5
yeah ?,2,if you don't have ... I mean ...,8
Teddy ? would you please please please take me to the prom ?,13,shut UP ! are you serious ? of course I will ... of course .,15
"Ted , have you lost your mind ?",8,you like me . I like you . I guess it's pretty obvious to everyone .,16
I don't LIKE you . we're JUST friends .,9,but that smile .,4
"oh , Ted , duh . I smile at everyone since I got my braces off .",17,so you'll think about it ?,6
so that's a maybe ?,5,"the answer is NEVER , Ted , NEVER . except maybe in your dreams .",15
"great jacket , Teddy Bear .",6,yeah ? you like ?,5
"Christy ? you want to be in "" Heaven ? """,11,I turned eighteen over spring break . I'm eligible .,10
"I thought I'd be nervous , but you sure know how to make a girl feel relaxed , Teddy Bear .",21,"I do ? I mean , yeah , I do .",11
"I have to admit , I am so totally turned on . we should do it . now .",19,do it ?,3
you know ... take the pictures ?,7,I remember the first time you walked into Mrs. Temple's class in 2nd grade . blue gingham dress . blond ponytail .,22
"which you pulled , hard !",6,"that was code for "" I like you . """,10
"I miss those days , when schoolyard sexual harassment was without consequence .",13,things change . now I'm taking off my clothes ... all by myself .,14
well ?,2,you have changed since second grade .,7
"I mean , what do you think ?",8,you expect me to think at a time like this ? there isn't a drop of blood in my brain .,21
I was always too shy to admit how much I liked you .,13,"come on , I was hamburger . you were porterhouse .",11
"maybe on the outside . but inside , deep down , I've always been dripping with special sauces . are you hungry ?",23,"God , you are so hot .",7
"what gives , Don Corleone ?",6,we reinvented ourselves .,4
new Hushpuppies don't make a new man .,8,you've obviously never had your dogs nestled in thousand dollar Italian loafers .,13
that explains the emptiness that haunts me .,8,jealousy is so unattractive .,5
not bad for a hack . he has a future in yellow journalism .,14,he kicked major ass and you know it .,9
"naked girls , wild sex , video games . no wonder it's called "" Heaven . """,17,this is a fun place ... but we don't usually come here until after the orgies .,17
never say never .,4,"oh , god . look . look .",8
let me get this straight ...,6,"if it isn't straight by now , son , you probably should see a doctor .",16
"these are real , live women ?",7,"we don't generally feature blow-up dolls in our magazine . but hey , if you think there's a market for it .",22
"come on , bro . spare yourself the humiliation , the degradation ...",13,you and your pep talks .,6
"don't get me wrong . we can salivate over all the Christy Malones of our lives . wishing we could devour them like melt-in-your-mouth filet mignon . but we're strictly hamburger guys . ground chuck , sixty eight percent lean , is about the best we can hope for .",50,"that's Charlie . my best friend . he's into beef analogies , partly because he's a butcher's son , and partly because , well , he's just into beef analogies . what can I say ? he's also a photographer ...",41
I genuinely think she wants me . I feel a vibe .,12,"that vibe is from your wrist , pal . you've been over-tenderizing your meat , again .",17
see ? did you see that ?,7,"she smiles at everyone , Ted . she's like a newborn with gas .",14
"the only chick more untouchable than Christy Malone is Miss April . "" hi , my name's Ginger . I love tofu burgers , rainy nights , and riding bareback . my biggest turn-off is cell phones during sex . "" here's a tip : set it on VIBRATE , honey , and don't be stingy with the lube . don't knock it till you tried it .",68,were you always this sick ?,6
"one thing for sure , Christy Malone ain't lookin THAT good naked .",13,"someday , I'll find out .",6
you have a better chance of being hit by a Mack truck with a refrigerated cargo bed full of sirloin tip .,22,"I defy your hamburger theory of life , and all of the unfulfilled hopes and dreams it represents .",19
that's crazy talk .,4,I defy any and all limits .,7
"don't do it , Ted . don't do it .",10,"any time , any day , a man can completely reinvent himself .",13
"think about it ... Long tunnel , bright lights , it's full of vaginal symbolism .",16,"poor Freud , turning in his grave .",8
"seriously , it's like we're being reborn . we really could reinvent ourselves here , just like you said . nobody knows about your massive humiliation .",27,nobody knows about your mental retardation .,7
nobody knows about your constant masturbation .,7,"and nobody knows you're a virgin ! aw , who are we kidding ...",14
what are the odds of there being ANOTHER Ted Nelson on our flight ?,14,Astronomical .,2
who the hell was your father ?,7,"well , Dad said ...",5
... A bouncer ? are you serious ?,8,maybe he got promoted .,5
"this is the life , baby . we get ourselves some tail and we're talking spring BREAK !",18,"cut it out , before you break something !",9
don't you know anything about limo etiquette ? everything in here is included for our pleasure .,17,"wait a second , I thought we were hamburger guys .",11
"I can't believe that's your mother . we're talking babe-a-licious chub fest , right here in the 501's .",19,perv .,2
"this is like my every wet dream come true . I don't even care that you're here , too , bro .",22,be cool . fake it if you have to .,10
"this isn't some 80's porno film , you dip shit . there are no wild sex orgies .",18,oh . well . maybe not yet .,8
"I'd kiss your mother with this mouth . I mean , if she wasn't , you know ...",18,so far away ? in Xenia ?,7
check this out . hurry !,6,"I better go , Dad .",6

beauty ? no . we're talking goddess .,8,I get it now . you and me . we're dead .,12
dead ?,2,our plane crashed . in the Grand Canyon . a big fiery explosion . we never made it to L.A. They needed dental records to identify us . and this place . this . actually . is . heaven .,40
"then there must be a whole room , made completely of chocolate .",13,and some really fast cars .,6
don't be such a pansy . all of this is yours .,12,it's a lot to digest . imagine how you'd feel .,11
"I'd feel like staying up all night ! forever ! or at least till I got the lay of the land , SO TO speak .",26,I feel like I'm entering a forbidden tomb ...,9
"oh , how inappropriate is that !",7,take a whiff of heaven .,6
how would you like it if I did that to your mother's panties ?,14,"I'd call you a sick , twisted fuck . but this is different . she wasn't your mother mother--",19
a couple of boys fighting over a pair of red silk panties is nothing compared to what he's seen .,20,"yeah , he's probably been serving cocktails , SO TO speak , at the orgies .",16
"you're late , bro !",5,"sorry . Ginger got a little , you know , enthusiastic .",12
you'll never believe who's in there .,7,it better not be my Aunt Trudy .,8
I feel like I've just been hit by a Mack truck .,12,with a refrigerated cargo bed full of sirloin tip .,10

"well , what do you think ?",7,I don't know - it's your house Ellen,8
yes - but you live here too - If it were your house ?,14,I think he's fine - I don't know why you have this thing about men - it would be nice to have a guy in the house for a change - I don't think he would hurt a fly .,40

and how long have you been a dentist ?,9,"oh , about six years since I graduated",8
and how many people have you killed ?,8,I don't know,3
you don't know ?,4,"no - the police say I've killed fourteen - but I've not - I've killed many more . it amazes me how they just haven't found the bodies . what is society coming to when people just don't get missed . I agree , some of them are well hidden - I probably couldn't even show you where I put them - one girl , number eight I think the press called it - she wasn't even mine - I don't know who did it but I didn't",88
where do you kill them ...,6,"oh anywhere - whenever I needed to - Do you know how easy it is to take them ? you just pick up a hiker , or someone off the streets - they believe so easily you know ,' Look , I have something to show you' I would say - and that would be it . one girl , I think her name is Debbie - she had broken down on the motorway , and I offered to take her to a service station to call for a tow truck - She just got in and I drove away . when I pulled into the layby and took out my knife - she just froze , and said - what do you want ? - I said , You know what I want . - But she didn't . getting rid of the bodies is just as easy - the first I cut up , put in bags with bricks in , and tossed them off Eldridge Bridge in broad daylight . the real problem with my work is the blood - there is so much of it - and it all spurts out so fast - like a fountain . it made such a mess of",208
my car I stopped working from my car . she could have stopped me you know - If she really wanted too . that is the difference between the confusion of humanity and the purity of the beast - If a dog attacked you - you could easily kill it without any damage to yourself - Why then do people get bitten by dogs - savaged ? why ?,69,I don't know,3
"because a dog will attack with a ferocity and force that we poses , but centuries of social contamination has run it out of us - that is what sets us aside from the purity of the beasts ... Society is rotting - men who once were strong and kept everything working are getting soft - women are making them soft - by the time a pretty girl has reached twenty - she has had three lifetimes worth of fun and attention- so she doesn't deserve any more -",89,didn't DEBBIE deserve anymore ?,5
no she didn't ...,4,what did you do with her ?,7
"you know everyone accuses me of being sick - the press , the TV - but I'm not you know - they are - I don't watch it for entertainment every night - I don't sit and watch it whilst eating my dinner - they all say , how could he cut her up ? she was dead - I can't hurt something dead - And all this whilst they slobber down their processed beef burgers by the dozen - I couldn't eat one of those burgers , you don't know what has gone in them !",97,the press think that the white angel is a woman - why is that ? do you dress up Leslie ?,21
I don't want to talk about it -,8,"OK , the press call you the white angle because you only kill girls wearing white - why white - white clothes , blonde hair ...",26
I don't know ...,4,"is' their' colour an expression of their inner self ? by that I mean , extroverts wear bright colours - so what are people who wear white ?",28
I don't know ...,4,is white an expression of innocence ? do you crave innocence Leslie ?,13
"let me ask you , why do you wear black Ellen Carter ? what are you running from ?",19,do you feel sorry for the girls you have killed,10
why should I feel sorry - they're dead .,9,how long have you been watching me ?,8
I have something I have to show you ...,9,tell me about your wife ...,6
"my wife My wife was the only one who really deserved it . Leslie do this . Leslie do that . Leslie it's your fault ... She used to tell me what to wear , where to go , what to do - she mothered me ...",47,then why did you marry her -,7
it seemed like a good idea at the time - why did you marry your husband .,17,what didn't you like about her ?,7

that can't feel good .,5,"no , it doesn't ... Okay , look , I see what you're doing here , and that's , I'm sorry , but that's not it . my marriage is fine . I've had some kind of "" empty-nest "" episode where I saw some things that weren't there . let's deal with that . I'm willing to deal with that . I just don't want to go conjuring problems where none exist .",74

"guys , if I'm going to play the hero at least give me a little room .",17,safety in numbers man .,5
this time I really don't see anyone man .,9,"must be what we came for . the four stand slowly and enter through the doors , which close behind them . they begin walking around the WAXWORKS , which appear gruesome . the first they spy is of a high school student with a letter jacket on the verge of being hacked with an axe by and angry woodsman . they give each other looks of disgust and continue on . the next is of a Frankenstein-esque creature carrying a woman in its arms . the four are now roaming around the WAXWORKS individually , with TONY encountering what appears to be a tribal INDIAN pointing a knife towards a victim . mark walks past a circus cart with some sort of werebeast inside , and then continues on to a staircase exhibit with a dead woman at the base of it . on the staircase is a zombie-fied creature . we see China walking on the other side of a bandage wrapped man pumping gasoline into a woman's mouth . finally , we see TONY walking up to a cottage room display .",185
haven't we been doing our homework .,7,I've always wondered why someone would believe in something like that .,12
"getting scared ? don't worry , they've probably just gone home .",12,"what ? Tony and China , together ?",8
Wooo . jealously rearing its ugly head .,8,"I'm not kidding . I want to get out of here - now , ok .",16
then why do you still like her ?,8,like her ? I don't know if I ever liked her . it's just you want what you can't get .,21
I don't know . I really like you and I think you're very attractive .,15,come on .,3
no I'm serious . it's. it's just I don't know I. I'm looking for something else .,17,"no , no James , it's not like that . Tony and China , they're just friends .",18

"listen Sarah , I think I know what's going on ok . I went to the waxwork today.I met this man .",22,oh that explains everything .,5

the same interest as yours Larry . money . I thought it'd be a good investment for my kid ...,20,"no . this time I'm in for the long term . this is not a liquidation , Gordon . I'm going to turn it around . you're getting a free ride on my tail , mate , and with the dollars you're costing me to buy back the stock , I could modernize the plant . I'm not the only one who pays here Gordon . we're talking about lives and jobs ; three and four generations of steel workers ...",81

Well Christmas is over and business is business . keep buying . dilute the sonofabitch . Ollie I want every orifice in his body flowing red .",82,"he's flowing , Gordo . piece of cake .",9
"hey , the Terminator ! blow' em away Ollie .",10,"and , I'm pretty sure we got the Beezer Brothers out of Tulsa coming in with us and I'm working on the Silverberg boys in Canada .",27
"what do you say we go get a suite at the Carlyle ? caviar ? champagne ? celebrate , just like the old times Sunshine .",26,"those days are over , Gordon . they were over a long time ago .",15
"it's not puppy love , Gordon . anyway , Buddy and I are splitting up .",16,sorry to hear that . I thought the kid had staying power .,13
"it's over you , Gordon .",6,you told him about us ?,6
"now tell me , why would I want to do that ?",12,because I don't want to see him hurt .,9
don't worry Sunshine . Bud and I had a little talk . we came to an understanding . I want you to go back to him . soothe him . help keep his head straight . okay ?,38,I can't ... and I won't .,7
"come on , we both like Buddy . but this bleeding heart puppy love act is over the top ... It doesn't fit .",24,maybe it does . don't patronize me Gordon .,9
"you and I are the same , Darien . we're smart enough not to buy into the oldest myth running : love ... A fiction created by people who got nothing to keep them from jumping out of windows .",40,"you're really twisted , Gordon . you're incapable of giving to anybody because deep down inside you there's a poverty that every last dollar in the world won't fill .",30
I thought this was an informal meeting . what's he doing here ?,13,"Harold , you don't mind strolling around the block a couple hundred times , do you ?",17
"frankly , Carl , I can't see giving much more . if you have any suggestions I'll be glad to listen .",22,there came into Egypt a Pharoah who did not know .,11
I beg your pardon . is that a proverb ?,10,"no , it's a prophecy . the rich have been doing it to the poor since the beginning of time . the only difference between the Pyramids and the Empire State Building is that the Egyptians didn't have unions . I know what this guy is about-- greed--he's in and out for the buck and he don't take prisoners . he don't give a damn about Northstar or us ...",70

You got something for the small fry ...",19,"Jesus , can't make a buck in this market , country's going to hell faster than when that sonofabitch Roosevelt was around ... too much cheap money sloshing around the world . the biggest mistake we ever made was letting Nixon get off the gold standard . Putney Drug--you boys might want to have a look at it .",59
sleep with me and the secrets of the West are yours .,12,"now that's a crap company , sure you'll make money on the takeover rumor , but what's being created . nothing . no substance behind it .",27
"no such thing Bud -' cept death and taxes . not a good company anymore , no fundamentals . what's going on Bud ? do you know something ? remember there're no short cuts son , quick buck artists come and go with every bull market but the steady players make it through the bear markets . you're part of something here , Bud . the money you make for people creates science and research jobs . don't sell that out .",82,"you're right , Mr. Mannheim , but you gotta get to the big time first , then you can be a pillar and do good things .",27
"can't get a little bit pregnant , Bud .",9,"it's a winner Mr. Mannheim , trust me -- buy .",11
you're on a roll kiddo . enjoy it while it lasts --' cause it never does .,17,"... just kickin' ass and taking names , Mr. Mannheim .",11

"destiny took us apart , but I knew it would bring us back together .",15,Aha . poet or philosopher ?,6
stock broker . as in : never have so few done so little for so much . so what do you see in this ?,25,"I'd give anything to have this in my house , even for a week .",15
... few thousand dollars down the drain if you ask me .,12,"oh really ? well , I guess you can kiss that career as an art appraiser goodbye , because we paid over four hundred thousand for it at the Contemporary picture sale last June .",35
you could have a great beach house for that .,10,"sure you could , in Wildwood , New Jersey . if you sold this , you could have a pretty nice penthouse on Fifth . but you wouldn't have much left over for decoration .",35
"boy , I thought Gordon was a tough businessman , but somebody's really taking him to the cleaners here .",20,"not really . I'd say that Gordon is one of the most astute collectors around . he has a great eye and he only buys the best . like this rug for instance , a silk Tabriz , the finest of its kind . the day after he bought it in London , a dealer representing the Saudi Royal Family offered him twice what he paid . it absolutely makes the room . see how this little bit of celadon in the border is picked up in the cushions oh the sofa ... although ... I don't know if I would have used that tea dipped linen for the upholstery - too dingy . and it's a sacrilege having that Pre-Columbian pot in the center of the coffee table . some dope might use it as an ashtray .",139
I gather you're a decorator .,6,"you got it , a great spender of other people's money .",12
"well , if you're that good , you could probably do wonders at my place .",16,where is it ?,4
upper West Side .,4,oh really . home of the exposed brick wall and the houseplant .,13
oh it's just a rental . I'm moving to the East Side soon . I've got a couple of deals brewing with Gordon. but that's just conversation ... what about real things ? like dinner . the two of us . Friday . cafe . Santo Domingo .,48,what if I have a previous engagement ?,8
break it .,3,I guess this must be destiny alright . my first yuppie apartment and ... my first yuppie .,18
you really do believe in destiny ?,7,only if I want something bad enough .,8
Devon ? he looks like Seattle slew . what about the triple Crown ?,14,"he's not a racehorse , Bud , he's a jumper .",11
how would I know ? I once bet a horse . he went out at ten to one and came in at quarter to five .,26,if I could have anything ... this would almost do .,11
"so , how did your conference go with Gordon ?",10,"the conference , oh yeah . fine . we reached an agreement and decided to divide up the world between us .",22
you have modest wants . I like that in a man .,12,and what do you want ?,6
"... a Turner , a perfect canary diaiaond ... a Lear jet ... world peace ... the best of everything ...",21,"well , why stop at that ?",7
I don't .,3,you're not trouble by any chance . are you ?,10
... isn't it perfect !,5,... too perfect ... let's not even eat . let's just watch it and think about it .,18
"you know , the elevator man couldn't believe I paid $ 300,000 to have my walls looking like this , he's got them for free in Brooklyn .",28,"I'll bet he's got an opinion on the stock market too . this apartment is already ahead of its time . I call it the "" demolished "" look . they've already heard about it at House and Garden and they're coming next week to photograph it before it gets ... lived in . is that alright ? I'd love to have it in my portfolio .",67
"let's get things straight , Bud . I'm not going to take a cut . I worked hard and you can't decorate a room in New York for less than $ 100,000 . curtains alone ...",36,"I'm kidding , I'm kidding , we're still young , Darien . so what's money anyway when everybody's making it , it's all relative . after all , this is not the house in Connecticut , this is just a crash pad good for a couple of years ... before we slip our two lovely kids , yuppie and Fruppie into the Lycee Francaise .",65
"you got it all charted out don't you , like a stock projection .",14,"that's right -- one with high yield , rich assets and no downside ...",14
do you think you're ready ?,6,"it's not me I'm worried about ... You know Darien , the only reason we haven't slept together is because we both know we will -- and not knowing when was the only surprise left . you owe me , I want you , what else is there ... but you , me , the world . ... right here ... make love to me ... now ... Stop me if I'm going too far .",76
"Bud , I hate to tell you this but you're a genius ! Darien ... lightning has struck ! the lightbulb has been invented . Edison , Da Vinci , Einstein are watching ...",34,... are you going to trade all night again ? you got to go to work in a couple of hours .,22
"get in bed . y'ever hear of the sixty hour work week ? you're turning into a yuppie Frankenstein , you love money so much .",26,"sure , why not , money's the sex of the 80's . I never had it like you when I was growing up , baby , it wasn't the upper east side .",33
"you're so naive Bud , you don't even know . your dad took care of you . I might've been rich when I was a kid ... but my father lost all his money ... in the Seventies , in the stock market , at the track . he was a lousy gambler ...",54,"... that changes all my plans , I thought you were loaded ...",13
"fear . the fear of being poor I guess , just like you , Darien ... But that's all gonna change sweetheart . I'm catching the express ... ... and you're going along for the ride .",37,I'm sorry . I was afraid something like this could happen .,12
talk about being bent over the sink of life and being dry humped . I handed it to him on a silver platter . I told my father and those people ...,32,"buddy , it's not your fault , and it's not your decision .",13
I'm not gonna let it happen Darien .,8,don't cross Gordon . he'll crush you . you've worked hard to get where you are . if Gordon doesn't buy Bluestar someone else will ; and who's to say they won't do the same thing .,37
at least I wouldn't be pulling the trigger .,9,"are you mad ! why are you doing this ! we're so close , the town is going to be ours . don't throw away your future Bud !",29
I can stay with the brokerage firm . and you're doing fine . we can survive without Gordon Gekko .,20,I'm not looking to just survive . I've been doing that all my life .,15
"you really mean that ? what'd he promise you ? to take you public ? I guess without Gordon's money and seal of approval , I'm not such a hot investment anymore . you're just the best money can buy , Darien ...",43,"you're not exactly pure Bud , you went after Gekko with the same vengeance you went after me . look in the mirror before ...",25
you may not believe this Bud but I really do care for you . I think we could've made a good team ... but that's how it goes ...,29,get the hell out !,5

"... Yeah , and we're working on some other interesting stuff .",12,"... A cosmetics company by any chance ? what are you , the 12th man on the deal team ? the last to know ?",25
"can't tell you that , Mr. Gekko .",8,"so whatta you got for me , sport ? why are you here ?",14

"Mr. Gekko -- thank you for the chance . you won't regret this , you're with a winner .",19,"... put the rest of it in a money market account for now . I want to see what you know before I invest it ... and save the cheap salesman talk , it's obvious .",36

I sold it a couple of years later and made an $ 800,000 dollar profit . it was better than sex . at that time I thought that was all tne money in the world ... Now , it's a day's pay ... I had a mole in Wildman's employ . gave me half the picture , then he got fired ...",99,I don't understand .,4

I could lose my license . if the SEC found out , I could go to jail . it's inside information , isn't it ?",38
"inside information . oh you mean like when a father tells his son about a court ruling on an airline ? or someone overhears me saying I'm gonna buy Teldar Paper ? or the chairman of the board of XYZ suddenly knows it's time to blow out XYZ . you mean that ? I'm afraid sport , unless you got a father on the board of directors of another company , you and I are gonna have a hard time doing any business ...",84,what about hard work ?,5

Hamlet . what's David Berkowitz got to do with Sid 6.7 ?,12,he's part of the mix . Sid 6.7 is a composite .,12

what does that mean ?,5,"now that he's in the real world , there are no longer limitations on his behavior like there were in virtual reality . Sid is going to evolve .",29
sounds to me like a well — educated way of saying you have no idea what to do next .,20,"what I do know is that whatever he's becoming , Sid 6.7 is going to be even worse than he was before .",23
I forgot what real coffee tastes like ...,8,"you know , considering you've only been out of prison for seven hours , you're re — adapting quite well . wait , I didn't mean that the way it sounded . I meant ...",35

how did you find out about the toxin ?,9,Sid 6.7 told me after he killed the two guards . he suggested I kill you rather than him .,20
you're not capable of it .,6,"I pose an unacceptable danger to the public , remember ?",11
"I told you before , Grimes liked to be obvious .",11,Sid 6.7 isn't Grimes .,5

you've already fulfilled the terms of your pardon . you stopped Sid 6.7 and you've got his module . you're free to go — — right now . why are you going to do this ?,36,you don't know ?,4
that's why I'm asking .,5,"because this pain — in — the — ass criminal psychology expert has helped me understand what I'm capable of . and what I'm not . and better than anyone else , I am capable of stopping Sid 6.7 .",40

"which God would that be , the one who created me , or the one who created you ? in your world , the Lord giveth , and the Lord taketh away . but in my world , the one who gave me life doesn't have the balls to stop a couple of bureaucratic assholes from taking it away .",60,"what do you expect me to do , put your character module in my pocket and just walk you out of here ?",23
you catching my drift ?,5,I think I understand what you have in mind ...,10

I wonder how that ...,5,turn it down !,4
he's developing a Hemisphere imbalance .,6,talk so I can understand .,6

I haven't been working on anything .,7,do I get to see it or not ?,9
get that fucking thing away from me !,8,you're ... such a wimp .,6
watching your VR people Auto reset gave me the idea .,11,"it's nano — technology , isn't it ? machines the size of molecules ...",14
coordinated by polymer neural net .,6,it feels so .. .real.,5
it's better than real . it's synthetic flesh . synthetic blood . synthetic organs ... It's a physiological machine .,20,this is supposed to be years away .,8
"as far as the public is concerned , it is . the reason you got fired , and I got my second demo into production , is I'm a lot smarter than you . I never give my best stuff away .",42,how do you kill it ?,6
"amazing . I hate to say it , but it is .",12,"I know . I'm ready to incubate something a little more advanced than a coldblooded reptile . if you want to experience the future , meet me in my office in 15 minutes . and bring the Sheila 3.2 character module with you ...",44
you need a maid .,5,what I need is a nymphomaniac .,7
you embarrassed me in front of the highest — ranking law enforcement official in the country . do you have any idea how much money you just cost me ?,30,the reason you insisted on testing my system with prisoners is because of the increased risks involved with increased realism .,21
I'm still making Adjustments ...,5,"you've had a year — and — a — half to make all the Adjustments you want , Lindenmeyer . ) Elizabeth Deane does not give second chances . neither do I. You're fired .",35

what did Cox pull him out early for ?,9,"Barnes used to work for him when he was still a cop in the field , remember ?",18
what the hell happened ?,5,"Lindenmeyer developed neural connectors that tap directly into the nervous system . if the simulator isn't calibrated properly , experiencing death in this level of VR is like experiencing death within a dream . the experience becomes real .",39
"simulations are supposed to give participants practice in realistic , dangerous scenarios while protecting them from the risks they are exposed to in the real world .",27,I was assured the problem was corrected .,8
it makes me nervous just seeing him in a uniform . I will never forget the first time I saw the photos from the crime scene .,27,"neither will the public . the media has caught wind of his pardon . unless Mr. Barnes starts giving me some tangible results , I'm going to put him back in his cage .",34
"I watched your simulation , Mr. Barnes . very impressive . you know , you're the only one to ever go up against Sid 6.7 who is still alive .",30,only because I got pulled out early .,8
not from in here .,5,this is a full pardon . it authorizes your immediate release .,12
"if Sid 6.7 hasn't killed you , we throw you back in here and you serve out the rest of your sentence .",23,how do you know I won't run ?,8

enough to level an entire city block .,8,"if I were you , I'd get every demolition team in the city searching in and around the Biltmore Hotel .",21
demolition teams have searched everywhere in and around the hotel . I don't know where ...,16,"Sid is smart enough to know you'd check everywhere in the immediate area . whatever the device is , he's probably got it timed to move into position just before it detonates . have the demo teams check every subway tunnel , water pipe , gas pipe , and sewer pipe that goes under , over , or into the arena .",62
you know how much man power you're talking about ?,10,you're the highest law enforcement official in the country . use the fucking army if you need to .,19
this better not be a wild goose chase .,9,"or what , you'll authorize my death a second time today ?",12

"letting a lunatic like Parker Barnes loose in the free world is like lighting a fuse . at some point , he will go off -- you saw what happened in the simulator . the risk to the public is unacceptably dangerous .",43,not if you're with him every step of the way .,11
"the man played judge , jury , and executioner with eight people's lives . he lost control and is capable of doing it again .",25,"I understand the risks involved here . but there is nobody better qualified to go after Sid 6.7 than Barnes . and , there is nobody who knows him better than you . if a situation becomes volatile , you will find a way to quell it . I have complete confidence in you .",55

I should have told him .,6,"don't blame yourself . in your shoes , I don't think I would have told Parker , either . so do you think Grimes has become the dominant personality ?",30
I'm not sure . my guess is that's what Sid wants us to think .,15,you think he's smart ?,5
I think we both know who did . what's so urgent ?,12,I need your help--,4

it's not your fault . we appreciate you trying .,10,"look , I feel bad about this , so I'm going to try to look into the programming of his Maestro teaching tool for you . ) I've had one sitting around for years . maybe I can learn something that you'll find useful .",45

I know that you used to work with an architect .,11,"and do you know that my mother and I had to suffer ? if my father had bothered himself a little more about us , I'd be an architect now .",31
I don't understand how you can like being alone so much .,12,"I'm not like you , you have your wife .",10
what are you doing here ? get out .,9,leave him alone .,4
you won't get much done with those people . those times are over ! you ought to let me kick them out .,23,"do they worry you that much , then ?",9
"I know perfectly well how little I can do . what I want to do is give passing Beggars a roof , some food , and a bit of human warmth .",32,is that all you're going to devote your life to ?,11

"sit down , I'm going to need your help .",10,what's the matter ?,4
"I'd be really ungrateful , if I didn't like you , sir ; you took me and my little girl in when I didn't know where to turn .",29,"yes , yes , but there's no need to bring that up . how far are you prepared to help me ?",22
"just say the word , sir , and I'll do anything .",12,"why don't you speak to her , Ramona ? women are good at that sort of thing . think of something that will make her stay a few more days . you are kind , Ramona ! speak to her . I know I don't need to offer you anything , but , if you're successful in this , I'll not forget you or your little girl .",68
"but sir , what can I say to her ? and why should she pay any attention to what a servant tells her ?",24,"the way she looked at me , Ramona ! she hates me now . I think I've made a great mistake . she's going away , she's going away and nothing will stop her .",35
speak to her again . explain everything to her seriously .,11,what for ? she'll only look at me that way again ... I couldn't . you go . perhaps she'll listen to you . try to convince her .,29
"but what can I say to her , sir ?",10,"tell her I lied , that I didn't take advantage of her .",13
"you believe me , don't you ?",7,"yes , sir .",4
don't lie . you don't believe me either .,9,"it's only that ... It's all very odd , sir .",11
"yes , Uncle . how are you ?",8,"I'm well ... The bus was late , wasn't it ? ... What was the journey like ?",18
"excellent . what a charming , peaceful place , Uncle .",11,you'll think you're still at the convent .,8

how did you know about that ?,7,"oh , some years ago I heard my mother talking about it . but is it true ?",18
"yes , it is .",5,don't you ever see him ?,6
never .,2,how could anybody behave like that ?,7
sometimes these things happen because of inexperience . sometimes it's because of ...,13,evil .,2
his mother wanted to keep him . she came from a poor family . I was in love with your aunt . I would like to have acknowledged him but I was afraid of losing her . that's why I didn't say anything .,44,and this innocent child .,5
"thank you , Uncle .",5,this evening we must do something special by way of a farewell .,13
whatever you like .,4,I should like you to do something for me . it's an innocent sort of thing but I'm very set on it .,23
"how strange you are ! when I asked you to do this favor for me you refused . you seemed almost offended . and now , here you are , making me so very happy all of a sudden . thank you , my child !",46,"I don't like masquerading , but as you see I decided to give in to your whim .",18
you must think I'm mad .,6,"no , Uncle , and now I'm pleased to have been able to do this favor , because , although I didn't think so at first , you are really a good man .",34
"if you only knew ... When I was young I was full of idealism . I wanted to do something on a big scale for others , something to show my great love for humanity . but as soon as I tried to do something about it , I became afraid that I would be laughed at and I felt like a fool ... and so I went back into my shell .",73,wasn't that cowardice ?,4
"Uncle , you mustn't think that I won't be sad to leave you .",14,"it's up to you entirely . don't leave , then ...",11
unfortunately ...,2,"it's my fault . if I'd come to see you more often , if I'd invited you here for holidays , maybe everything would be different .",27

let me pass !,4,you must listen to me before you go .,9
I've listened to you long enough . let me out .,11,"all that I said just now was a lie . I said it so you wouldn't leave . I only molested you in my thoughts ... I can't bear to have you leave me , hating me like this . tell me you believe what I'm saying and I'll let you go .",53

call 911 .,3,shut up .,3

now ?,2,that's right .,3
isn't it a little late ?,6,"hold on a sec . Lois , you sure you wouldn't rather do this in the morning ?",18

yes money . Adam had a five hundred dollar term Life Insurance Policy .,14,what does that mean ?,5
"actually , no . Adam was switching to a Whole Life Policy , but re-scheduled his medical exam ... and failed to make his last payment ... so his term Life lapsed . so it's value is Null and void . now he did have a pension account , worth another 150 thousand .",54,"well , oh ...",4

you don't just casually walk out of a Vegas Casino with a dead woman .,15,we can do this . we can get her out of here .,13

I just want to see you as much as I can !,12,"as friends ? we'd just see a lot of each other as friends , and you'd "" take care of me "" ?",23

I need you .,4,why ?,2
"I can't do it alone . I need you , to be Madeleine for a while . then , when it's done , we'll both be free .",28,I'm scared .,3
"... We stood there and I kissed her for the last time . and she said , "" If lose me , you'll know that I loved you --",29,Scottie --,2
"and I couldn't follow her . God knows I tried . one doesn't often get a second chance . I want to stop being haunted . you're my second chances , Judy .",33,take me away ...,4

we're going up the tower .,6,you can't . you're afraid !,6
I'm going to . it's my second chance .,9,"Scottie , please ... !",5
"but you knew , that day , that I wouldn't be able to follow you didn't you . who was at the top when you got there ? Elster ? with his wife ?",34,yes !,2
"and she was the one who died . not you . the real wife . you were the copy , you were the counterfeit . was she dead or alive when you got there ?",35,dead . he'd broken her neck .,7
"took no chances , did he ? and when you got there , he pushed her off the tower , was that it ? but you were the one who screamed . why did you scream ?",37,"I wanted to stop it , I ran up to stop it --",13
yes !,2,"and you were such an apt pupil ! what fun you two must have had , playing games with me ! why me ? why did he pick on me ? ! !",33
your accident ...,3,"ah , yes ! I was a set-up . I was the made-to-order witness . where is he now ?",20
I don't know ... Switzerland ?,6,we'll find him .,4
I made it .,4,what are you going to do ?,7

"and the necklace . Carlotta's necklace . that was your mistake , Judy . one shouldn't keep souvenirs of a killing . you shouldn't have been that sentimental .",29,what are you going to do ?,7
"I loved you , Madeleine .",6,"I was safe when you found me , there was nothing you could prove ! but when I saw you again I couldn't run away , I loved you so ! I walked into danger and let you change me again because I loved you and wanted you ! Scottie , please ! you love me now ! love me ! keep me safe !",65

"no , she's all right . she's still here . but I'll get her home soon .",17,what happened ?,3
did she hurt herself ?,5,no . she's in fine shape . nothing to worry about . but she doesn't know . you understand that . she doesn't know what she did .,28
"how'd you get into the shipbuilding business , Gavin ?",10,I married into it .,5
interesting business .,3,"no , to be honest , I find it dull .",11
you don't have to do it for a living .,10,"no . but one assumes obligations . my wife's family is all gone ; someone has to look after her interest . her father's partner runs the company yard in the East -- Baltimore -- so I decided as long as I had to work at it , I'd come back here . I've always liked it here .",59
how long have you been back ?,7,almost a year .,4
and you like it .,5,San Francisco's changed . the things a that spell San Francisco to me are disappearing fast .,17
like all this .,4,I'd like to have lived here then . the color and excitement ... the power ... the freedom .,19
shouldn't you be sitting down ?,6,"no , I'm all right .",6
I was sorry to read about that thing in the papers . and you've quit the force . a permanent physical disability ?,23,"no , Acrophobia isn't a crippling thing . it just means I can't climb steep stairs or go to high places , like the bar at the Top-of-the-Mark . but -- -- there are plenty of street-level bars In this town .",42
would you like a drink now ?,7,"no ... no , thanks . a bit early in the day for spirits . well , I guess that about covers everything , doesn't it ? I never married ; I don't see much of the "" old college gang "" ; I'm a retired detective -- and you're in the shipbuilding business . what's on your mind , Gavin ?",62
not what you think . we're very happily married .,10,then ?,2
I'm afraid some harm may come to her .,9,from whom ?,3
no .,2,"if I told you I believe that his happened to my wife , what would you say ?",18
"I'd say you'd better take her to the nearest psychiatrist , psychologist , neurologist , psychoanalyst , or plain family doctor . and have him check you both .",29,"then you're of no use to me . I'm sorry I wasted your time . thank you for coming in , Scottie .",23
I didn't mean to be that rough .,8,"no , it sounds idiotic , I know . and you're still the hard-headed Scot , aren't you ? always were . do you think I'm making it up ?",30
no .,2,"I'm not making it up . I wouldn't know how . she'll be talking to me about something , nothing at all , and suddenly the words fade into silence and a cloud comes into her eyes and they go blank ... and she is somewhere else , away from me ... someone I don't know . I call to her and she doesn't hear . and then with a long sigh she is back , and looks at me brightly , and doesn't know she's been away ... can't tell me where ... or why ...",97
how often does this happen ?,6,more and more in the past few weeks . and she wanders . God knows where she wanders . I followed her one day .,25
where'd she go ?,4,"watched her come out of the apartment , someone I didn't know ... walking in a different way ... holding her head in a way I didn't know ; and get into her car , and drive out to ... Golden Gate Park . five miles . she sat on a bench at the edge of the lake and stared across the water to the old pillars that stand an the far shore , the Portals of the past . sat there a long time , not moving ... and I had to leave , to got to the office . that evening , when I came home , I asked what she'd done all day . she said she'd driven to Golden Gate Park and sat by the lake . that's all .",134
well ?,2,"the speedometer of her car showed she had driven 94 miles that day . where did she go ? I have to know , Scottie . where she goes and what she does , before I got involved with doctors .",41
have you talked to the doctors at all ?,9,"yes , but carefully . I'd want to know more before committing her to that kind of care . Scottie --",21
"I can get you a firm of private eyes to follow her for you . they're dependable , good boys --",21,I want you .,4
it's not my line .,5,"Scottie , I need a friend ! someone I can trust ! I'm in a panic about this !",19
"how can I see her , to know her ?",10,we're going to an opening at the opera tonight . we'll dine at Ernie's first . which is easier ?,20
Ernie's .,2,"all right . you won't know what to look for at first , Scottie . even I , who know her so well , cannot tell , sometimes , when the change has begun . she looks so lovely and normal ...",42
"you've done well , Scottie . you're good at your job .",12,that's Carlotta Valdes .,4
yes .,2,there are things you didn't tell me .,8
I didn't know where she was going to lead you .,11,but you knew about this .,6
Carlotta Valdes was what : your wife's grandmother ?,9,Great-grandmother . the child who was taken from her whose loss drove Carlotta mad and to her death - was Madeleine's grandmother .,23
"well , that explains it . anyone could develop an obsession for the past , with a background like that .",21,"but she doesn't know , about her background . she never heard of Carlotta Valdes .",16
"knows nothing of a grave out at Mission Dolores , or an old house an Eddy Street , or a portrait at the Palace of the Legion of Honor ?",30,nothing .,2

... he wants to testify ... ?,7,it looks that way .,5
you know what that would mean ? to get somebody from a Boston hospital to say he'll testify ?,19,... a Mrs. Doneghy called ... I told you that .,11
this is going to drive the ante up .,9,Frank Galvin's ... who's calling please ? Bishop Brophy's office ...,11
that's the call that I'm waiting for .,8,what does it mean ?,5
they want to settle . it means a lot of money .,12,does that mean I'm back for awhile ?,8
"it's a generous offer , Mr. Galvin ... ... nothing can make the woman well ... but we try to compensate ... to make a gesture ...",27,how did you settle on the amount ?,8
we thought it was just .,6,you thought it was just .,6
yes .,2,because it struck me how neatly' three' went into the amount . two Hundred Ten Thousand . that would mean I keep seventy .,24
that was our insurance company's recommendation .,7,yes . it would be .,6
nothing that we can do can make that woman well .,11,and no one will know the truth .,8
what is the truth ?,5,"that that poor girl put her trust in the hands of two men who took her life , she's in a coma , her life is gone . she has no family , she has no home , she's tied to a machine , she has no friends --and the people who should care for her : her Doctors , and you , and me , have been bought off to look the other way . we have been paid to look the other way .

he was accused of jury tampering .,7,accused . not indicted . he resigned the firm . divorced nineteen seventy . Galvin worked with Michael Morrissey until Morrissey retired in' seventy-eight . since then he's been on his own . four cases before the Circuit Court . he lost them all . he drinks .,48
four cases in three years ...,6,the man's an ambulance chaser ...,6
... tell me about this case .,7,this is a nuisance suit . he's looking for small change . he's asking for six hundred thousand and betting we don't want to go to court .,28
no -- we don't want this case in court .,10,neither does he . that's where he loses . this man's scared to death to go to court . we only have to call his bluff .,27
I want to settle this thing and be done with it . I don't want the Archdiocese exposed .,19,"no . absolutely , and we're going to see that it is not .",14
so what I want to do is stop it here . I'm going to make him an offer . I want to do it myself . I want it to come from me .,34,all right . but let's keep the price down . I've called Ed Concannon . he recommends that we continue to respond as if we're going to trial .,29
"if we were to go to trial , would we win the case ?",14,"well , of course , it's always dangerous ...",9
I know that answer . if we went to trial would we win ?,14,yes .,2
why did he go to see Mary Rooney ?,9,she's the only nurse who isn't testifying for the Doctors .,11
what did he find ?,5,nothing .,2
how good's your intelligence ?,5,very good .,3

"he was a corrupt cop , verbal .",8,"sure . fifteen years ago , but he was a good thief Anyway , the cops wouldn't let him go legit .",22
Keaton was a piece of shit .,7,"you trying to get a rise out of me , Agent Kujan ?",13
"according to your statement you are a short-con operator . run of the mill seams . everything you do , you learned from somebody else .",26,that's been suppressed . anything in there is inadmissible .,10

"you know a dealer named Ruby Deemer , verbal ?",10,you know a religious guy named John Paul ?,9
you know Ruby is in Attica ?,7,he didn't have my lawyer .,6
there's nothing in there about Ruby .,7,I' 11 be sure to mention that to him .,10
"the first thing I learned on the job , know what it was ? how to spot a murderer . let's say you arrest three guys for the same killing . put them all in jail overnight . the next morning , whoever is sleeping is your man . if you're guilty , you know you're caught , you get some rest - let your guard down , you follow ?",71,no .,2
I' 11 get right to the point . I'm smarter than you . I' 11 find out what I want to know and I' 11 get it from you whether you like it or not .,36,I'm not a rat .,5

"oh come on , verbal . who do you think you're talking to ? you really expect me to believe he retired ? for a woman ? bullshit . he was using her .",34,he loved her .,4
sure . and I'm supposed to believe that hitting the Taxi Service wasn't his idea,15,that was all Fenster and McManus .,7
come on . Keaton was a cop for four years . who else would know the Taxi Service,18,"you keep trying to lay this whole ride on t Keaton . it wasn't like that . sure he knew , but Edie had him all turned around. r I'm telling you straight , I swear . +",38
"let me tell you something . I know Dean Keaton . I've been investigating him for three years . the guy I know is a cold- + blooded bastard . L.A.P.D. indicted him on three counts of murder before he was kicked off the force , so don't sell me the hooker with the heart of gold . +",59,you got him wrong .,5
I don't know about that .,6,"I don't think you do . but you say you saw Keaton die . I think you're covering his ass and he's still out there somewhere . I think he was behind that whole circus in the harbor . my bet is he's using you because you're stupid and you think he's your friend . you tell me he's dead , so be it . I want to make sure he's dead before I go back to New York .",80
he wasn't behind anything . it was the lawyer .,10,what lawyer ?,3
you think I don't know you held out on the D.A. ? what did you leave out of that testimony ? I can be on the phone to Ruby Deemer in ten minutes .,34,the D.A. gave me immunity .,6
"not FROM ME , YOU PIECE OF SHIT . there IS NO IMMUNITY FROM ME . you atone with me or the world you live in becomes the hell you fear in the back of your tiny mind . every criminal I have put in prison ,",47,there was a lawyer . Kobayashi .,7
is he the one that killed Keaton ?,8,no . but I'm sure Keaton's dead .,8
so this lawyer ...,4,Kobayashi .,2
came from Redfoot .,4,right .,2
"do you believe in him , verbal ?",8,"Keaton always said : &amp; quot ; I don't believe in God , but I'm afraid of him . &amp; quot ; Well I believe in God , and the only thing that scares me is Keyser SOZE .",39
"I came clean . I told it like it happened on the boat . so what if I left out how I got there ? it's got so many holes in it , the D.A. would've told me to blow amnesty out my ass . so you got what you wanted out of me . big fucking deal .",59,and this is why you never told the D.A.,9
"you tell me , Agent Kujan . if I told you the Loch Ness Monster hired me to hit the harbor , what would you say ?",27,turn state's evidence . take the stand on this and we'll hear it out .,15
I've got immunity now . what can you possibly offer me ?,12,if there is a Keyser Soze he'll be looking for you .,12
"where's your head , Agent Kujan ? where do you think the pressure's coming from ? Keyser Soze - or whatever you want to call him - knows where I am right now . he's got the front burner under' your ass to let me go so he can scoop me up ten minutes later . Immunity was just to deal with you assholes . I got a whole new problem when I post bail .",76,so why play into his hands ? we can protect you .,12
"that was how I ended up in a barber shop quartet in Skokie , Illinois .",16,this is totally irrelevant .,5
"oh , but it's not . if I hadn't been nailed in Illinois for running a three card Monte in between sets , I never would have took off for New York . I never would have met Keaton , see . that barber shop quartet was the reason for everything .",52,can we just get back to Kobayashi ?,8
"the quartet is part of the bit about Kobayashi . the quartet was in my file , along with every other thing I had done since high school , see ? aliases , middle- men . they knew me better than I did . they knew all of us .",50,"you're stalling , verbal .",5
"give a guy a break , huh ?",8,what happened ?,3
then what ?,3,McManus was furious . he was talking about tracking him down and ripping his heart out and all sorts of shit . that night we got the call .,29
I wanted to . I thought we could make it .,11,why didn't you say anything ?,6
a man in a suit with a slim build . tall .,12,wait a minute .,4
"don't shine me , verbal . no more stalling . you know what I'm getting at .",17,I don't .,3
I don't know what you're talking about .,8,you KNOW . you'VE known THIS WHOLE FUCKING TIME . give IT TO ME .,15
"I don't understand what you're saying . I saw Keaton get shot , I swear to you .",18,then why didn't you help him ?,7
"I WAS AFRAID , OKAY ? somehow , I was sure it was Keyser Soze at that point . I couldn't bring myself to raise my gun to him .",30,but Keaton ...,3
"he was a stool pigeon for the Justice Department . he swore out a statement to Federal Marshals that he had seen and could positively identify one Keyser Soze and had intimate knowledge of his business , including , but not exclusive to , drug trafficking and murder .",49,I never heard of him .,6
his own people were selling him to a gang of Hungarians . most likely the same Hungarians that sate all but wiped out back in Turkey . the money wasn't there for dope . the Hungarians were going to buy the one guy that could finger Soze for them .,50,I said I never heard of him .,8
but Keaton had . Edie Finneran was his extradition advisor . she knew who he was and what he knew .,21,I don't,2
there were no drugs on that boat . it was a hit . a suicide mission to whack out the one man that could finger Keyser Soze so sate had a few thieves put to it . men he knew he could march into certain death .,47,but how - wait . you're saying SOZE sent t us to kill someone ?,15
he wanted me to live .,6,"why did he want you to live ? a one-time dirty cop without a loyalty in the world finds it in his heart to save a worthless rat-cripple ? no , sir . why'",34
Edie .,2,"I don't buy that reform story for a minute . and even if I did , I certainly don't believe he would send you to protect her . so why ?",31
because he was my friend .,6,"no , verbal . you weren't friends . Keaton didn't have friends . he saved you because he wanted it that way . it was his will .",28
no ...,2,Keaton was Keyser Soze,4
"no , NO , NO , NO , NO .",10,the kind OF MAN THAT COULD HAVE KILLED Edie FINNERAN .,11
Edie ...,2,he used all of you to get him on that boat . he couldn't get on alone and he had to pull the trigger himself to make sure he got his man . the one man that could identify him .,41
this is all bullshit .,5,"he left you to stay behind and tell us he was dead . you saw him die , right ? or did you ? you had to hide when the first police cars showed up . you heard the shot , just before the fire but you didn't see him die .",52
I knew him . he would never -,8,he programmed you to tell us just what he wanted you to . Customs has been,16
"if he's dead , verbal - if what you say is true , then it won't matter . it was his idea to hit the Taxi Service in New York , wasn't it ? tell me the truth .",39,it was all Keaton . we followed him from the beginning .,12
I didn't know . I saw him die . I believe he's dead . Christ,15,"why lie about everything else , then ?",8
"you know what it's like , Agent Kujan , to know you'll never be good ? not good like you . you got good all fucked around . I mean a stand up guy . I grew up knowing I was never going to be good at anything' cause I was a cripple . shit , I wasn't",58,you're not safe on your own .,7
you think he's .. ?,5,"is he Keyser Soze I don't know , verbal . it seems to me that Keyser sate is a shield . like you said , a spook story , but I know Keaton - and someone out there is pulling strings for you . stay here and let us protect you .",52
"you posted twenty minutes ago . Captain Leo wants you out of here a.s.a.p. , unless you turn state's .",20,"I' 11 take my chances , thank you . it's tougher to buy the cheapest bag-man than it is to buy a cop .",24
"where are you going to go , verbal ? you gonna run ? turn states evidence . you might never see trial . if somebody wants to get you , you know They'll get you out there .",38,"maybe so , but I'm no rat , Agent Kujan . you tricked me , that's all . I won't keep my mouth shut' cause I'm scared . I' 11 keep it shut' cause I let Keaton down by getting caught - Edie Finneran too . and if they kill me , it's",53
"even if I was to let you talk to him , he won't talk to you . he's paranoid about being recorded and he knows the interrogation rooms are wired",30,"this won't be an' interrogation , just a ... friendly chat to kill time .",15

and I am sure you have a host of wild + theories to answer these questions .,17,you know damn well what I think .,8
"that's crazy , Dave and it doesn't matter . he has total immunity and his story checks out . he doesn't know what you want to know .",28,"I don't think he does . not exactly , but there's a lot more to his story . I want to know why twenty-seven men died on that pier for what looks to be ninety-one million dollars worth of dope that wasn't there . above all , I want to be sure that Dean Keaton is dead .",58
his name was Arturo Marquez . a petty smuggler out of Argentina . he was arrested in New York last year for trafficking . he escaped to California and got picked up in Long Beach . they were setting up his extradition when he escaped again . get this - Edie Finneran was called in to advise the proceedings .,60,Kobayashi .,2
what do you mean I can't see him ?,9,"the D.A. came down here last night ready to arraign before they even moved him to county .

"I wouldn't point no pistol at nobody , sir .",10,"a wise policy . but if you did , I can assure you , the sight of royalty would cause you to dismiss all thoughts of bloodshed and stand ... in awe . whereas , a president ... I mean , why not shoot a president ?",47
"now this Strawberry Alice person , tell me again .",10,down the street and across . Greely's Beer Garden and Billiard parlor . just ask for Alice and say you want a game of billiards .,26

how so ?,3,"football wasn't the kind of life I wanted ... For ten years I'd be by the phone waiting for a call telling me he broke his neck in a practice game . and if it wasn't that call , it would be a call telling me he blew out his knee or suffered his third concussion . I've seen way too much of it in my job ... I can barely take it when my clients are in pain . I don't hate the game . I admire the amount of skill it involved and , like everyone else , I was in awe of how he could play it , but I couldn't give him my heart and then have something happen to him . and it always does with that game . it's not a thing many people would understand .",143
"any way , fate stepped in and took football out of the equation .",14,... And everyone lived happily ever after .,8
is this a religious thing ?,6,I own a comic book museum . it's called the Limited edition .,13
for a second there I thought you were a fanatic .,11,I believe comic books are based loosely on reality -- I believe there are real life equivalents of the heroes in those books that walk the earth -- I believe your husband is one of those individuals .,38

how certain are you that you haven't been sick in your life ?,13,seventy-five percent .,3
seventy-five percent ? that's not nearly good enough for me . I'm extremely skeptical .,15,skeptical about what ?,4
what's he talking about ?,5,in college . a car accident .,7
I assumed because of the train .,7,you assumed wrong .,4
"you forgot the "" Now I'm going to tell you what the hell is going on "" step . see usually that comes before the , "" It's over "" Step . and it always , always comes before the "" You can go "" Step . what is over ?",51,the life of an idea that has lived too long in my head .,14
"this city has had its share of disasters . well publicized ones . it was around the time of that plane crash , when it first entered my head . and there it stayed , as I waited and watched the news over the years ...

at the church ... You were following me weren't you ?,11,technically no . I gambled that you would attend the church service . I just waited for you .,19
what's this about ? this is obviously some scam . is this where you tell me one of those pictures is like an investment ?,25,you've misunderstood .,3
it's for last week's game .,6,I've come to understand that ... An ill advised purchase in the parking lot .,15
what do you want ?,5,not money . but I appreciate your healthy cynicism in the manner . it will be wise for both of us to proceed with greatest caution .,27

listen . I got to be on the sidelines during the game ... You can get to your seat by taking the stairwell at--,24,"characters in comic books are often attributed special powers . x-ray vision , things of that sort .",18
"okay , I don't want to play this game anymore .",11,it's an exaggeration of the truth . maybe it's based on something as simple as instinct . like being able to touch someone and tell whether they've done something wrong ... Or the level of what they've done wrong .,40
the guy might not have been carrying anything .,9,or he might have been carrying a silver handled gun tucked in his pants .,15
I have to go now .,6,one last question .,4
quick .,2,the car accident you were in ... Was there anyone else involved ?,13
I must have felt some lump in his back when I bumped him . most guns have a black or silver handle . I had a fifty-fifty shot at the color .,32,that's not what I witnessed David .,7
