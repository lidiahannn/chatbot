good ones , yes , Mr Vereker . gentlemen who can ride and shoot 
Lord Chelmsford seems to want me to stay back with my Basutos . 
and I assure you , you do not In fact I'd be obliged for your best advice . what have your scouts seen ? 
lighting COGHILL' 5 cigar : our good Colonel Dumford scored quite a coup with the Sikali Horse . 
well that's typical of Her Majesty's army . appoint an engineer to do a soldier's work . 
which one ? 
Ft could be you flatter yourself CoghilL It's that odd eye . 
keep steady . you're the best shots of the Twenty-Fourth . you bunch of heathens , do it 
yes . 
well , fed or hungry , Pulleine wants them in position immediately . . 
yes . I see you've issued each of them with a Martini Henry carbine . our quota for Native contingencies : one rifle to ten men and only five rounds per rifle . 
our runners bare his dispatches , do they not ? 
thank you . 
a large party of Zulus have been sighted in the direction of the King's KraaL Getting up , CHELMSFORD moves over to look at the map on his desk . 
certainly , Sin 
Sikali Horse , My Lord . Christians all I know each one by name . 
my Lord . this list was prepared for you . I don' t think another can understand its true value . 
I have received intelligence from , sources of my own that the Zulu Impis are moving North of here and threaten your left . 
and the threat of counter invasion no longer exists ? 40 
excuse me , My Lord . Norris-Newman , of " The standard " , My Lord . 
Indeedldid , MyLord . Itwas one ofthe first to cross . 
they spurred onto high ground , My Lord , full of spirit and looking for the Zulu . full of sport they were , My Lord . 
if I've got it right , My Lord , you lead an invasion into Zululand , for I see it all around me , but " why ? " is the question my readers will ask . " why ? " 
so attack is your defence . well let's hope Cetshwayo will offer his Impis full destruction . 
eleven o'clock , My LorJ 42 
I listened extra careful to your " Stand To " this mornin' , Boy. Ft was peifecL I couldn't' ve done it better meseif , not even when I was Bugler to The Duke Of Wellington .. .now tell me , where did you get that black eye ? 
so , you got it in the line of dooty .. ... point taken . 
could be . across the river into Zululand . . they might just be waiting there for us to show up ... .them stabbing assegais pointing right at our bellies ! .... 
one Zulu is only one man .. .. and I'm afeared of no one man ... but the Zulu , they come in the thousands .... like a black wave of death .... in the thousands .... and them assegais .... stabbing ! 
Zulu may not wear shoes or trousers and the like but it don' t mean to say they got no brains . they'll watch us and wait and find our weaknesses . 
food ! 
I'm sorry , sir . we only seat by reservation . 
oh , no sir-ee . if yo don't have a reservation you can skip to ma-loo . 
now just one moment . there's no need for roughhousing . have you ever tried a tip ? 
Franz ! help ! lunatic ! 
there must have been someone else down here then . 
his schwanzstucker . 
it's working ! oh , Doctor -- you play beautifully . 
why don't we all turn in ? it's been a long day . 
I think the doctor is a genius ! don't you , Igor ? 
how long is it so far ? 
three minutes to go ! 
what d'ya want to do to kill time ? 
absolutely ! may my mother grow two heads if I'm not telling the truth . 
Igor -- the clock ! hurry ! 
do Something ! stall them ! 
how nice . 
yes , thank you . it wasn't bad . 
I'm not sure I ... get your drift . 
just an atmospheric discharge . nothing to be afraid of . 
that's quite all right . what is it , dear ? 
we only arrived a few minutes ago . 
oh please -- just till I get sleepy . then you can force me right back to my room . 
well ... I'll just finish unpacking . 
yes , you may ... but don't make any noise . 
listen ! don't you hear that strange music ? 
I don't know . it just woke me up . 
whatever it is , it's coming from down there . I'm going down to see . 
all right then , quietly ! close your robe and stay right behind me . don't make a sound ! 
what a filthy mess . 
well , this explains the music . 
and look at this , Doctor ! 
oh , Frederick ... you're not only a great doctor , you're a great ... you're almost a ... 
yes ! 
raise the platform , hurry ! 
I thought it was wonderful . 
it wasn't me . 
what do you think we should do ? 
I think I'll ... carry him . 
me ? sing ? 
I'd be so nervous . 
stop -- singing ! ! ! 
are you serious ? ? 
oh ! yes , Doctor . 
I think so . 
good night ! 
wonderful ? it's terrible ! terrible , terrible , terrible , terrible , terrible ! 
oh , a little . but it's not just physical loneliness . it's the pangs that come from missing someone intellectually ... as I have you . 
it's terrible -- the price society demands in the name of fidelity ... ultimately ? 
I know , but I mean -- not fooling around physically ? ... Or not fooling around intellectually ? 
there can never ... ever ... be anything physical between us . you know that , dear . 
it wouldn't be fair to Elizabeth . 
I say , it wouldn't be fair to you ... or to me . 
no . nor to Elizabeth . 
yes , Elizabeth has hers . 
yes , I have mine . 
yes ... yes , you have yours . 
well ... ... perhaps for a few minutes . 
it wouldn't be fair to her . 
you've got to help me to remain faithful . 
... But an intellectual relationship , like this -- we could have as often as we wanted . three times a day -- anything ! 
mmmmm . 
yes , sweetie ... I heard you . so ! I'm ready for you , meine Liebe . 
MMMMmmmmm ! 
MMMMMMmmmmmmmmm ! 
Zis is an old Transylvanian lullaby . 
oh , just a little . 
ja , ja . 
it's alive ! 
MMMMMmmmmmmm . 
MMMmmmmmmmm . 
MMMmmmm ! MMMmmmm ! 
... It's . 
mmmmm ! mmmmm ! 
poo -- tmmm anngh ma Ritz ! 
soo -- pah doo -- per . 
... Su-per du-per . come let's mix where Rock- e-fellers walk with sticks or' um-ber- el-las' in their mitts ......................... 
for God's sake -- go on ! are you trying to make me look like a fool . sing , you amateur ! sing ! ! 
wait ! stop ! don't give them the satisfaction . I know it's tough , but look at how far we've come ! are you going to throw it all away now ? ? 
don't you think I know that ? but what are you judging by ? Bucharest ? ? ? this was always a hick town . they can't get a' bus and Truck' company to come in here . are you going to let these idiots get the best of you ? ... Or are you going to stand up like a man and show them that you've got more dignity in your little finger than they've got in all their beer- bloated bodies put together ? 
Fron kon steen ! 
no , it's pronounced Fron kon steen . 
no , Fred ereck . 
it's not . it's Fredereck Fronkonsteen . 
you must be Igor . 
but they told me it was Ee gor . 
you were sent by Herr Falkstein , weren't you ? 
I'm sure we will . 
how do you do ? 
yes , just the two . 
what hump ? 
I beg your pardon ? 
I thought you wanted to . 
suit yourself ... I'm easy . better watch out for the wockers . 
the wockers with the knockers . 
go ahead , play dumb ! you'll lose your sockers and then be fockers . 
I wonder what's got into them ? 
Fro-derick ! 
I got frightened all alone upstairs , so I came down here . 
just putting up some tea . 
what ? 
what ? 
what ? 
two switches over there , but I wasn't going to be the first . 
no , but when I first came in , there was a light coming from behind that steel door . 
must be the music room . 
&apos; how I Did It .' good title ! 
yes , I think we could all use a good laugh . 
could be worse ! 
could be raining ! 
do you have the name I wrote down ? 
I want that brain . 
was he any good ? ? ? he was the finest natural philosopher , internal medicine diagnostician and chemical therapist of this century . 
and he wrote seventeen cookbooks . 
can you imagine that brain in this body ? 
he only died two weeks ago -- I'm sure they'll still have him . hurry now . I'll prepare the body . 
why ? 
if you like -- just hurry ! 
yes , master . just don't turn on any radios . 
all right ... elevate me ! 
tonight ? 
you've got it , master . 
this guy means business . 
what ? 
throw the third switch ! 
but there must be a reason . this is science , not art . 
you mustn't take it so hard . Bucharest wasn't built in a day . 
well , I don't like to see you mope . 
I'm sorry . I don't mean to take out my frustration on you . you've been a great help to me , and I've let you down . 
you're right ! self-pity never got anyone anywhere . let's go back and finish our dinner . 
who are you talking to ? 
I didn't make a' yummy' sound -- I just asked what it was . 
it wasn't me . 
I suppose you're right . Inga ! prepare a sedative , just in case . 
don't fall for that one . 
give -- me -- your -- hand ! 
you can say that again . 
you're just supposed to repeat what you said . 
I'm not trying to be funny . 
... I'm glad that's ... 
... Whew ! I'm glad that's over with . 
Ayegor ! find out where that music is coming from as quietly and as blindingly fast as you can . 
act casual ! 
what did you find out ? 
where is he ? 
how do you know it was a' she' ? 
can you play it ? 
that's what we're paid for . 
come on , Froderick -- none of that . 
what d'ya mean " What monster ?' you remember ... the one we madein the basement . 
what ? ? ? 
... and equalize the imbalance in his cerebrospinal fluid ... 
there's only one way . 
yes , master . are you sure you want to go through with it ? 
okay , boss ! but I hope you know what you're doing . 
I beg your pardon ? 
oh ! I thought it was Dr. Frankenstein . 
that's true ! but my grandfather , Victor was , after all , what we might politely refer to as ... a cuckoo ! 
well sir ... I'm not sure I understand the distinction between' Reflexive' and' voluntary' nerve impulses . 
yes ? 
a piece of what ? 
are you speaking of the worm , or ... the spaghetti . 
my father was a sick man . 
you are talking about the gibberish ravings of a lunatic mind . 
how old are you , young man ? 
nineteen ! my dear young man ... once the human organism has ceased to function , nature has deemed that creature to be dead . 
hearts and kidneys are Tinker Toys ! I'm talking about the Central Nervous System . 
I am a scientist ... ! not a philosopher . 
but your grandfather's work , sir ... 
Fron kon steen ! 
but I can't just drop everything and leave . I have responsibilities and obligations . 
how long will this whole thing take ? 
I'll have to think it over . it's not so easy just to pick up and ... 
why did you do that ? 
I didn't do that . 
yes , sir . 
one week -- I'll see to it , sir . 
not at all -- a great privilege , Doctor . 
Saturday night , yes , sir . have a pleasant journey ! 
it seems fine . 
does that include the key to the laboratory ? 
yes ! ... the laboratory . 
yes , this was Victor's ... the Baron's medical library . 
I don't know what you mean , sir . 
this is the only library I know of . 
I think you must be mistaken , sir . 
will there be anything else ? 
I put her in the guest room , just down the hall . 
Elizabeth ! ? !' can't waits any longer . arrive in your arms at ten tonight .' oh , God ! not tonight . 
of course . 
yes . 
yes , don't worry . 
yes . 
I promise . 
oh , darling -- so will I. 
very .... very ! 
oh , nice . 
whatever makes you happy . 
you're incorrigible ! 
you bet your boots it does . 
goodbye , darling . 
goodbye , darling ! 
darling ! 
surprised ! 
love you ! ... Well , why don't we turn in ? 
I mean , it's been a long day . I'm sure you must be as tired as I am . oh ! these are my assistants : Inga and Ayegor . 
yes . I am a bit tired , after all . 
yes , he's a little bit ... tilted . harmless , though . 
are you suggesting I call him master ? ? ? 
all right then ! 
darling , you mustn't worry so . 
but you can't do that at night . and even if you could -- it would cost a fortune . come to bed , darling . 
you've done everything that's humanly possible , Frederick . oh , darling , I'm so worried about you -- you need rest . 
of course I am . now come along like a good boy . 
yes , but ... I thought , perhaps tonight , under the circumstances , I might ... stay here with you . 
would you want me , now , like this , so soon before our wedding ? ... So near we can almost touch it ? or wait a little while longer , when I can give myself without hesitation ? ... When I can be totally and unashamedly yours ? ? 
is it worth taking a chance ? 
of course I am . now give me a kiss and say good night like my good boy . 
that's my good boy . 
hello ... ? 
well ... yes . 
I ... 
Baack ! 
Baack ! 
MMMmmmm . 
is it that music ? 
mmmmm . 
mmmmm . 
mmmmm . 
mmmmm . 
I did , sir . 
was he aware of the importance of this occasion ? 
what lecture could be more important than the will of Baron Beaufort Frankenstein ? 
Herr Falkstein ! you have your instructions ! 
I have taken an oath that each letter of this Testament shall be executed ... and by God , it shall be done ! 
from your office , sir . 
yes , sir . but I must have taken the wrong one when we came up . 
no , sir . it will never happen again . 
yes , sir . 
he has a big mouth . yes ! it seems to me I did read something about that incident as a student . but you have to remember that a worm -- with very few exceptions -- is not a human being . 
yes , sir ? 
yes , sir . do you want the other cauliflower ? 
Frederick Frankenstein ? 
and who might you be ? 
the grandson of Victor' Fronkonsteen' ? 
what was your grandfather's name ? 
forgive me for intruding so late at night , Herr Baron . but an ugly rumor has it that there are strange goings on in this castle . these good citizens are ready to rip you from limb to limb unless you can offer some rational explanation for their fears . how say you ? 
they say , also , that you have recreated the horrible monster who , for so many years , has haunted and terrorized the God-fearing people of this village . what say you to that ? 
now wait a minute ! 
and has he achieved ... any special degree of eminence ? 
oh , shit . 
and I'll never understand terrorists . 
not at the cost of lives , Max . 
still trying to make the world safe for our kind . still trying to find a way to introduce ourselves -- definitively . 
let's just say that I am out to make some radical changes . now come on Charles . for old times sake , for your sake ... Leave him to me . 
the way what is going to be ? 
what do you mean to do ? 
what DO YOU MEAN TO DO ? 
I know . 
it does indeed , Max . 
I feel a great swell of pity for the poor soul who comes to that school again looking for trouble . 
how ? 
a piece . only a piece . 
enough for a test . 
alive . 
the sun is setting , Logan . you've been asleep for nineteen hours . 
she borrowed your power to save her life . when she touches someone , she absorbs their strengths -- their gifts . in your case -- your ability to heal . that's why she keeps her body covered . 
if she held on any longer she could have . 
I brought you here so that you would be safe from magneto . 
a very powerful mutant who for some reason has taken an interest in you . I'm not sure why , but until we find out , I must ask you to stay . 
deal . 
this . this whole God damn thing . making yourselves into some sort of " team " of super-powered freaks . teaching wayward mutants about classical literature . for what ? 
what if it never happens ? what if they're so afraid of us that we become the enemy ? -- This place is gonna be one giant cemetery . 
no . that's me talking . and you know what ? it's only been thirty-two hours and you still have no idea what this guy wants with me . 
to find Rogue . 
the brainwaves of mutants are quite different than those of the average human being . 
actually , magneto helped me put it together . 
we were friends once ... But that was a long time ago . 
actually I'm feeling up to leaving . 
what ? ... miss me ? Charley , I'm gonna walk out the front door and trust me , it won't be soon enough for everyone here . 
what do you want ? 
you think I care about her ? I'm the only one who's sure to walk out of here . 
you're backstage at the encore of creation . 
Mr. Guyrich has been dead for some time Senator . 
intention ? intention , Senator ? we are talking about mankind here . his fear . it is only a matter of time before mutants will be herded into camps . studied for weaknesses . and eventually wiped off the face of the Earth . 
let's just say , God works too slowly . 
I am avoiding a question that is decidedly loaded , Senator . the wrong person behind the wheel of a car can be dangerous . 
math . history . science . English . Athletics -- 
control , Senator ... we teach them control . 
I presume nothing , I am here to tell you that in time , the mutator gene will activate in every living human being on this planet . perhaps even your children , Senator . 
treat you like a mutant ? we are not what you think . not all of us . 
the mutant gene tells the body when it needs to change . 
there's no smoking or drinking on the school grounds . 
I'll see what I can do -- You should get some sleep . even with your healing ability , you're going to be hurting for a while . 
the Professor said you were a solider . actually , I believe he used the word mercenary . 
maybe , the Professor could help you with that . 
if necessary . 
he's busy right now . 
what do you say ? 
he takes himself seriously . 
I've seen a lot of rings . 
I wanted to talk to you . 
I don't remember . is that what you wanted to ask me ? 
you know , you -- 
sure you are , sport . 
I don't like him being here . 
you saw what happened tonight . you think magneto won't come after him again . you think he won't come here if necessary . this is a school , for God's sake . 
his vital signs are weak and getting weaker . 
we have to find magneto . 
no . I'm ... I don't know if we can do this without Charles . 
well , I think that's perfectly understandable . 
what's that ? 
into the Hudson ? 
it's too far . 
can the Professor repair his own mind ? 
for what purpose ? 
so where do you think he's planning this larger demonstration ? 
the neuro-filter acts like a surge Protector , regulating the infinite flow of information from Cerebro to the Professor's mind . it's what keeps him from being crushed by the consciousness of millions . 
... until he found tungsten . 
we all do . 
beast . 
this pizda ? never seen him before . 
he flashed his badge to half the bar when he bought his drink . 
thanks , but I'm here on business . I heard you're the G around here . I'm looking for some cars , expensive ones . a lot of them . 
I'm talking about the sports cars that disappear off the docks in Genoa and wind up here . if you don't know about' em , who does ? 
when else are you gonna do it ? 
I had to inspect the merchandise first . 
what's this ? 
you tell me ! you got a sniper up there or what ? 
bullshit ! you get your boy off that roof or I swear to God I'm gonna give you another hole to breathe out of . 
what's " anarchy 99 " ? 
you wanna see my politics ? 
that's what I'm talking about , man ! that's why anarchy 99 was born . 
you got it , man . it's stupid but it's true . true freedom is when you do whatever you want anytime you want . that's when you know you're living , man . 
easy . you get enough money that you grow an ass big enough for the whole world to kiss . 
it's a beautiful town , Prague . it's been good to me . 
you , an Army brat ? I don't see that one at all . did you join the service as well ? 
connections and politics , it's the same everywhere . 
that's alright , I'm kinda tired . 
I wanted to get the hell out of Prague before silent Night falls . 
you think I'm after money ? I told you , my friend . anarchy . time for a change . money is good , but for true freedom you have to get rid of the rules themselves . 
easier than that , buddy . I'll get them to destroy each other . you kill an entire Peace conference , someone is going to have to pay . then our friend Ahab continues down the river to the ocean and begins his world tour . London , Cairo , Beijing ... Pretty soon everyone's involved . these guys bomb those guys , those guys invade these guys . soon the whole world is like your wild West cowboy days . no rules , no law , everybody free to do what they want . 
sure , if that's what you want . why not ? it's all human nature . so we just have to launch our baby and wait for the decline and fall of civilization as we know it . 
come on , Xander . you used to stand for something . what happened to you , man ? I thought you'd get it . 
oh just shoot us already . I'm sorry I asked . 
been to any good diners lately ? 
he's a pretty good actor , though . 
it's like you said , every man for himself . 
looks like we're in the middle of the drug war . 
I've been on a plane for twelve hours , I think I'll stand . 
here we go again . 
the corner . anarchy 99 . 
you killed me , remember ? now I have to hide out here with you . where have you been ? 
is this what you're looking for ? 
what's the deal ? 
they came and found me . they said they'd kill me unless I help them . plus they offer me a lot of money . no big deal . these things happen . dump your gun on the floor . 
I'm through , Xander . 
you run around with maniacs jumping motorcycles in the desert , you break 36 bones crashing wave runners and snowboarding off cliffs , all with no health insurance ... It's insane , I can't take it anymore . 
you have all this talent , and you waste it . you won't take a single endorsement deal . meanwhile those other guys have their own video games ! but no , you've got too much " integrity " for that . 
alright , so I'll get more . 
well if you're bailing , I guess I'd better give you your surprise now . 
I was gonna wait till the islands , but ... 
of course I'm serious . I bought it , didn't I ? 
I don't know . I thought this is what you wanted . you want stability , here it is . 
you're not exactly " going anywhere " yourself . 
that's would be me . 
I stole your beat , huh ? guess you forgot to brown-nose the right people . 
why don't you show me some gear before you get hurt . 
they come in any other styles or colors ? 
that one I'm real familiar with . 
think again , that's government property . you have to sign for everything . I've got one more that wasn't on your list . 
it's a stakeout suit . it's got food , water , recording gear , anything you need for covert spying . it's all- weather , fire retardant , and if you give this buckle a sharp pull , the whole outfit deploys into a parachute . 
now that I've given you the overview , we're going to spend the next couple hours going into extensive operational detail . 
perhaps he is not all he says he is . 
it all happened so fast . such an unfortunate accident . 
I'd forgotten how exciting it is working together . 
why don't we go below decks and work off some of this adrenaline . 
the Peace conference ... 
I have Japanese buyers who are looking to move a fleet , if you have the quality of merchandise they're after . and it's a mil two , max . 
is she for real ? honey , maybe you should quiet down and let the grownups have a conversation . 
sure . just chisel some off your heart . 
Yorgi asked me to . 
go to hell . 
mind your business . 
I was invited . what's your story ? 
come on , don't front like that . you'll put a guy right off you . 
that right ? why's that ? 
we hung out last night , remember ? 
hey , take it easy . I'm just a dude trying to make a buck . 
you've got to relax , baby , you're paranoid . 
maybe we should start again , yes ? I know so little about you , except that you're not what you say you are . 
the eyes don't lie . all this has gotten to you , hasn't it , Petra ? you came in as Yorgi's girlfriend and you stayed because it was fun . now you don't like it so much , but you're in so deep you can't get out anymore . tell me if I'm wrong , Petra . 
look at you . you're helping run things now . you're a gangster . I bet that snuck up on you . you woke up one day and you were a criminal . 
I'm an information gatherer . you wanna go somewhere and talk about it ? 
I'm from L.A. 
let's just say I'm freelancing and leave it at that . 
don't judge a comic book by it's cover . 
don't even start . I'll be honest , I don't trust you . Bur lets pretend for a minute that what you say is true , that I want to leave . what can you do about it ? 
all I have to do is risk my life providing you with these facts . 
a beach named X ? that I'd like to see . 
what are you talking about ? 
it's a long story , but yeah , more or less . 
if I go out the back , he'll know you've warned me . 
not an option . just get up slowly like everything's cool . Petra , trust me . you just hung yourself out to dry for me , I'm not gonna let you down . 
they'll kill you , you know they will . besides , there is no back door . keep smiling . ready ? now . 
no , something worse . he says it's a surprise , but I know him . this is his masterpiece . 
there's something I didn't have time to tell you before . 
I'm a agent as well . KGB . I've been undercover for over a year . 
I don't know . eight months ago I stop hearing from my people . no explanation , just silence . so I stay and I wait like I was told . soon I'm in so far , they'd kill me if I left . now every day I get farther and farther away from what I was . I'm like you said , a criminal . 
no , I guess I've been no help at all to you . 
of course . I'll do what I can . I have to go , before they notice . 
you can't , it's too risky . I'm not much help anyway , remember ? 
what the hell are you doing ? you could've killed me ! 
I don't know what's going on anymore . I thought I was square with that dude . now everybody's switching sides like it's the WWF . 
I know which cops are good and which are bad . come with me . come on , right now . 
wait a minute , whoa . we can't go now . what's Yorgi got planned with that nerve agent ? 
of course it matters . hey , hold on ! 
Petra , this ain't about the people that sent us here , you know that . 
we can't leave now . we have to do something . 
we'll have to go after them . 
a long time ago I learned how to put fear away in a little place in my head . maybe that's my problem . if you don't feel fear you can do some amazing things , but you can also screw your life up in ways you can't imagine . 
you don't have to do that . 
aren't they gonna wonder were you've been ? 
when this is over , we're just gonna take off , the two of us . take a vacation . 
Yorgi and Kirill . 
if they launch it , I know how to bring it back . 
go to the water , it's that way ! 
let me . 
a piece of shrapnel hit me . 
you can't talk to it ? 
a manual control on a moving torpedo . this day keeps getting better and better . 
it has to surface to release the nerve agent , right ? 
use your grenades ! maybe we can blow it up underwater ! 
you can't welch on me now . we had a deal . 
it's about your next mission . you need to be debriefed . 
slick graphics , huh ? see these dudes ? they're called " anarchy 99 " , they're the bad guy bosses . 
you wanna check it out ? come here . 
naturally . 
Kirill , the sniper . looks like a bookworm , but he had 72 confirmed kills in Chechnya , they called him the " finger of God " . assassination and weapons . 
" anarchy " 99 " ? 
what weapons do you have ? 
what do you get if you finish ? 
oh . I bet by the end he gets something out of it . 
he gets to be the hero . 
oh , I don't know . it was an accident . 
you saving me ? you talking pretty tough for a guy got himself chained to the ceiling . 
now you're gonna make me enjoy this , funny guy . now I'm gonna take the whole foot off . Whatchu think of that ? 
not a whole helluva lot . his final transmission was mangled . about something or someone called " Ahab " . whatever it is , it cost him his life . 
they're ruthless and they have a lot of firepower . it's only a matter of time before they figure out how to deploy silent Night . then we're gonna have a catastrophe on our hands . 
we're gonna have to step in , Sam . those CIA boys couldn't find a clown in a field of cactus . let me take care of it . 
I'll go in with a team . but first I'm going to need some intel . I'll have to put someone inside , someone new , someone they won't see coming . one of their own . 
you wanna find out about rats , ask a rat . I've had my people put together a talent pool . I downloaded it to your desktop . 
the scum of the Earth . 
I've seen enough . turn it off . 
that's exactly why we need them . 
I think we should send him whatever he wants . 
if it means getting silent Night back , absolutely . 
he's gotten closer in 24 hours than all of the other operatives combined . he got us an account number to boot . now even if he's just dumb and lucky , I say we back his play . I put him out there , Sam . if he doesn't come up with the money , they'll kill him . I can't let that happen . 
what is this place ? 
diner , huh ? let me tell you what the problem is . I wake up drugged to find what ? you've got a " salesman " over here reading a three week old newspaper . he's pulling a 211 with a " trucker " , who happens to be packing a cop issue H &amp; K 9mm . I get tipped that something is going down when she passes me a note . how's that for twisted logic ? how did she know there was trouble unless they pulled the guns before I " walked " in ? and if that's true , why'd they stop and wait until I woke up to gaffle the money ? then I notice how beefy they both are . hell , even the waitress is cut . all three of them look like they went through the same training program . Ergo they ain't strangers and this isn't what it seems . that's how I knew yo-yo wouldn't get a round off even if I gave him all day . why ? 
that shows me already that you don't have a clue . what's it to you , anyway ? 
good for you . now why don't you stop wasting my time and tell me what you want . you didn't go through all this for my benefit . 
a Fed , I shoulda known . who else would have this kind of budget ? now you're gonna hit me with the sales pitch . 
.. If you're trolling around for narcs , man , have you got the wrong guy . 
look at me , dude , do I look like a fan of law enforcement ? forget the tests , you shoulda just asked me . I woulda saved you a lot of trouble . 
are we done now ? you've got nothing on me . so if you ain't booking me , I'm walking . 
is that a fact ? 
you know what I hate ? any scumbag with a clean shirt and a bad haircut can get one of those tin stars and suddenly they think they're God . 
you're a cold piece of work . you almost got three people killed out there . 
you're perceptive too . I forgot to add that to the list of surprises . I'm with the National Security Agency . and unlikely as it may sound , I need your help . 
you're an adrenaline junkie with one foot in the penitentiary . you risk your ass building a daredevil myth that means nothing and you're not getting any younger . 
that's too bad . I thought a guy like you would appreciate the challenge . 
there's some folks I want to keep tabs on . dirty , tattooed , uncivilized . your kind of people . 
if you find out what I want to know , and if I'm able to successfully use that information , you get to go back to your degenerate little life . if not , you take a bath . 
wherever you go on the planet , I'll find you . there's no quitting . if you try to take it off , a ring of needles will inject enough curare into your bloodstream to kill you before you hit the ground . is all that clear ? 
fine , but I'm not gonna be no Bulldog Omega 5 . 
crude and defiant as always , triple X. It fits so well because you're obscene . 
just remember , I'll be watching . 
if you're trying to push my buttons , you're on the right track . don't make me question my own judgment , X. 
one point two million dollars ? I did not authorize you to spend one point two million dollars ! 
what the hell am I after ? you're telling me dick . 
call me crazy , but I thought hooking up a million dollar deal was a great way to get on their good side . what else ? you gonna hassle me about the weapons and spy stuff too ? 
I know , poison needles in my shins . you've got 36 hours . peace , out . 
yeah , I sent you pictures . here's what I'm thinking . if they take out the cameras and sensors , they could probably put a bomb in this thing . you drop it in the water in the Red Sea and three weeks later it's swimming up the Potomac . 
hey , one miracle at a time . they're on to me now , remember ? 
you're a grungy little Phoenix , you know that ? keep up the good work . 
I'm on the way with a team to relieve you . what's the latest ? 
come on , Gibbons , you can do better then that . 
Jesus Christ , Gibbons , this is something we came up with ? 
kinda funny , though , isn't it ? we're not supposed to be making weapons like that anyway . guess we shoulda played by the rules . 
we don't have that kinda time , boss , I don't think Prague's gonna be around much longer . I've gotta go now . I've got a lot of bad guys to kill . 
I'm pretty happy to see me too . so are you done with me yet ? 
but I hate cops , remember ? except for her . 
who says you're the good guys ? 
oh yeah ? why don't we start by taking this thing off my ankle ? the poison needles ? 
no needles , huh ? what about the acid bath ? 
you're a jerk-off , you know that ? 
ever see one of these before ? 
what is that ungodly smell ? 
fate of the world at stake , Adrian . can't get too worked up over bad press . 
Dr. Manhattan , right . now if you boys care to join me , we'll go save the world . 
no . I just hastened the inevitable . he's been ready to blow for years . I knew all it would take was a little push . so I , uh . . . gave his friends and associates cancer . 
before you do that , you might want to look at what I've been looking at . 
Edgar William Jacobi , aka William Edgar Bright , a.k.a. Moloch . 
terrorist . radical agitator . stool pigeon . 
worked both sides of the fence . ask your old buddies in the CTU . 
don't know . ask around . I'll be back . 
no , no . you got it all wrong . I been on the case , Rorschach , I got something for you . 
Laurie ! good to see you . 
and how's life with the walking H-bomb ? 
I'll take a raincheck , Laurie . 
he's a little farther gone every time . 
Laurie -- he's the most powerful man who's ever lived . he's changed the world . 
what about you ? 
nasty cough . -- Try one of mine . darling , you need to get out of the house . why don't you give Daniel a call ? I'm sure he'd be glad to hear from you . 
I'm sorry about Blake . 
I don't know their real names . 
you're not " protecting " anyone . these people's lives may depend on the answers you give . these are all former associates of Dr. Manhattan -- 
sit down , Miss Juspeczyk . as I mentioned , the people in this file are all close associates of Dr. Manhattan . they have something else in common as well . they've all developed a fairly . . . exotic form of Lymphatic cancer . 
I'm terribly sorry . 
six to eight months . that's with treatment . -- Perhaps now you can see why it's so vital that we locate your . . . friends . 
am I free to go ? 
I don't know why you've been keeping me here , but you're in deep shit -- 
Jon ? ? you mean he's -- 
Sphinx brand . when I got out of weapons design , I wanted to move into a more . . . humanitarian area . I was thinking : what would do some good in the world ? and I thought : why not a genetically-altered tobacco , that no only doesn't cause cancer -- but cleans out your lungs as you smoke it ? in fact I think I'll have one now . care to join me ? 
oh sweetheart , just a quick one . 
did you know he was back on the streets ? 
isn't it true that you -- 
nothing wrong with ketchup . 
anything for science , I guess . Janey , there's something -- 
nothing . what were you going to say ? 
Janey , will you marry me ? 
-- What ? 
did anybody follow you ? see you come here ? 
human bean juice . the comedian is dead . 
Rorschach , that was a long time ago . I mean , that -- that's just paranoia . 
hey . hey . if you don't mind , use the back stairs , all right ? 
toilet clogged . short fat turd . let's get out of here . 
Veidt's a fool . tried to warn him about new information . Sicced his mangy cat on me . 
Blake investigating missing scientists for CTU . Dr. Manhattan somehow involved . . . 
obvious pattern -- all ties in -- 
how do we know they've got cancer ? could be part of massive propaganda scheme . . . 
where's Laurie ? 
Veidt's assassin . leads to follow . can't just -- 
coward . giving up . 
sorry , Daniel . you've always been a good friend . I know that . sorry about Laurie . 
the guidance system's fried . I had to switch to manual . -- Some kind of massive electromagnetic shockwave . 
don't know . nothing I can think of -- -- outside of a nuclear blast . 
he's the one . he's been the one all along . stalking us . 
. . . and they call me a fucking nut . 
Dan , are you really that paranoid ? let's face it , Eddie Blake was no Mother Teresa . 
now wait . we all had the same option as Blake . it was work for the government or do time . 
 
damn straight ! we were heroes . 
well , that was Adrian's idea . I know he's the smartest man in the world and all that , but -- talk about publicity Hounds . . . 
that's the one . whatever happened to him ? 
you'll find something . -- I should go . you and me , seeing each other , someone might put two and two together . . . 
maybe not , but why take chances ? 
I'm gonna take a warm bath and sack out . -- You've been really sweet . sleep tight , okay ? 
his . . . whatever . 
I'd say you stalled out about forty years ago . Nellie Lutcher -- Louis Jordan -- I've never even heard of these people . 
sure . it works . I mean , look at this face , Daniel . I'm thirty-eight years old ! 
I like the way you look . it's strange with Jon . he doesn't age . his face doesn't change . but you , Daniel , you look . . . 
not at all . you look very -- dashing . here , you pick one . 
pick a record . I feel like dancing . 
are you kidding ? if they put him in jail he's dead . he'll never get to trial . 
the comedian . . . Jon . . . now Rorschach . 
one more down . someone tried to kill Adrian . . . . first time I've ever heard him scared . 
I know what you're thinking . you'd be a lot safer if I weren't around . 
I'm an open target , Dan . if you're with me -- 
memory lane . 
-- I thought it was time for a routine maintenance check . 
Antarctica ? ? 
you and me . 
me neither . mine barely even fits . the thing is , I try to remember why we did it , and I can't . helping people , or righting wrongs , or trying to save the world . . . I don't know . it all seems so abstract . 
what are you up to ? 
this'd better not be what I think it is . 
what the hell -- ? 
oh , Laurie . Jesus . no . 
all right . mission accomplished . 
I don't want to take' em out . just want to keep' em interested . 
that Detroit shit ? I'm so worried . 
the costumes . am I right ? 
yes you are . 
that's because -- 
you're full of yourself . what are you doing ? 
. . . what ? ? 
I think he's going to the john . 
will you two lovebirds keep it down ? 
what now ? fly south -- hook up with Adrian ? 
trying to change the past . he said it was the only way to save the world -- 
where did he go ? 
everything's changed -- 
wherever we are , it's better than what we left . backs together -- 
my God . murdered ? -- What's this have to do with Rorschach ? 
us . you mean the Watchmen . 
you know how he is . he goes on these binges , kills a couple of thugs -- then he's satisfied . it blows over . 
no . I just wanted you to -- 
good night . 
she's with me . 
thanks for the offer , Adrian . I'll let you know . 
uh huh . you might recognize the names . quite a few of them worked at Gila Flats . 
I couldn't let him interfere with my project . 
good Lord . how'd you get it on tape ? 
what is it ? how does it work ? 
Adrian -- you've lost it . 
I ¹ m not . 
then I ¹ ve been a very bad boy and you ¹ ll have to spank me . Christ ! I ¹ m doing what I have to do to save the godforsaken human race ! ! 
you ruthless son of a bitch . you really believe this mad-scientist bullshit is going to save the world ? 
yes . I heard this morning . Washington's asked me to attend the funeral as a matter of protocol . 
is it time ? d'you have to leave for the funeral ? 
Mm hmm . 
. . . and just how would you manage that ? 
collect me ? 
it will happen , Laurie . I've already seen it . neither of us can do anything to change it . 
Jesus , Jon , I nearly choked to -- where are we -- 
yes . in about . . . thirty seconds , for example , you'll tell me you're sleeping with Dreiberg . 
then you're sleeping with Dreiberg ? 
that's how time works , Laurie . everything is preordained . . . even my responses . we're all puppets . I'm just a puppet who can see the strings . -- thirty seconds . 
yet you must've known all along that you'd give me cancer . just be being with me . 
but you knew that I'd -- die . 
then it's going to happen . the world's going to end . -- And you've always known . 
then why don't you . . . do something about it ! 
because you can't , I know , it's preordained . so sorry . I forgot . Jon . this , this " script " you're following . . . who writes it ? 
I can't stand any more of this . I want to go back . if I'm going to die I want to be with -- other people . 
Jon , I do not want to hear it . 
oh God . I'm no more than a bug on a windshield to you . 
then do me a favor . if the world's going to end , it shouldn't matter a bit . I want you to cure me . 
you have the power to do it . I want you to do it . please . 
Jon . if you ever loved me -- if there's anything human left in you -- then do it . 
cured , yes . 
Jon -- what ? ? 
Veidt ¹ s complex . 
space and time . I finally understand , Laurie . I see it all now . 
I see what the watchmaker made . I see the universe ! 
hello , Adrian . 
we've lost a colleague . the comedian is dead . 
oh ? the CTU suspects a Libyan hit squad . 
life and death are unquantifiable abstracts . they don't concern me . 
you mean Afghanistan ? it won't require my attention . what I'm doing here is far more interesting . 
Jon ! get back ! you don't understand . 
don't call me that . 
wrong answers ? 
Hnnrr . -- Like to masturbate . shit once a day . 
who is she ? do you know her ? 
why , doctor . I did . he was a bad dog . 
God isn't there to do it . 
saw the world that night -- random , empty , hideous . God didn't make it that way . we did . we make the world -- in our own image . what else can I illuminate ? 
you oughta see upstairs . it's a slaughterhouse . 
he would -- You might as well know . it's gonna get messy . we got a call from Washington . 
they want in . seems our friend here was hardcore CTU . 
well , sir . . . in a worst-case scenario . . . we'd assume that twenty-five percent of the Russian birds get through . 
thirty minutes maximum . of course , I assume we'd be in the fortified command bunker at the time of the launch order . 
what about the aftermath ? this so-called . . . " nuclear winter " theory ? 
the weather . I see . keep me posted . I want hourly forecasts and a full report on optimum strike conditions . 
Laurie , I'll have to ask you to come with me . 
I can't tell you that . it is quite urgent . 
the access code's been changed . your card won't work anymore . 
please . 
and expensive . cost three million plus . 
anywhere in this circle . Iran , Iraq , Pakistan , Syria , Afghanistan ... 
where it can do the most damage . 
still no contact yet . 
is it ? 
how would you know ? 
of course ... 
what do you think ? 
no . it is the beginning . the world will never be the same . 
yes . au revoir ... 
please . 
is nothing . his kingdom he stole from my mother . the kingdom I will rightly take back . 
someone will come . 
to haul some cargo . my nephew , he is Captain of a sub in the Black Sea Fleet . 
bond ! 
former KGB surveillance post . the dye Factory was just a front ; now it turns a good profit . 
what class sub does your nephew run ? 
BondJamesBond . what brings you here ? 
bond , I ’ m a civilian . this is my place . used to be the royal family ’ s , now it ’ s mine . I run my little business , I stay out of trouble ... 
have some of the rat ’ s nest caviar . from my own fishery . they buy my caviar , drink my champagne , lose to my House . 
how does a terrorist like Renard supply his men with state-of-the-art Russian Army weapons ? 
if I remember my Cyrillic that says 101st airborne division . 
off a high-powered Paraski that was trying to kill me . 
how high up does this ... arms dealing go ? 
but you would have something to gain by killing Robert King . and stopping his pipeline . 
ah , I see . a purely ... plutonic relationship . 
what ’ s your business with Elektra King ? 
she dropped a million and half dollars to the House -- your House . and you didn ’ t even bat an eyelid . she was paying you off . what for ? 
a rope ! 
and the payoff on the tables ? 
no ! get me out ! 
this is a family matter ! if my nephew is in danger , we do it my way , or nothing ! now get me out ! 
where ? 
the right kind of explosion in the right spot -- it would block the Bosphorus , cut off the Black Sea . 
I ’ d heard there were some renovations there ... no one would look for a sub in that place in a million years . 
yes . 
God no . all those horrible loved ones and relatives . I don ’ t want to talk to those people . I just want to ... talk to my father . I loved him . I ’ m not sure he knew that . 
partially , yes . 
my bodyguard . he follows me everywhere . he ’ s decisive , vigilant . and he makes an excellent omelette . 
since the kidnapping . why do you ask ? 
it ’ s my father ’ s pin . he wore it everyday of his life . 
it ’ s not the pin your father wore . it ’ s an exact duplicate . inside is a tiny electrical detonator . we have reason to believe the assassin had an inside accomplice , someone who worked at this company . 
the killer doesn ’ t want to see this pipeline continue , doesn ’ t want to see you take over ... 
I think running this pipeline would be a difficult job for anyone . especially King ’ s daughter . 
always wanted to see the upper lines . 
no . 
we ’ re alright . 
you ’ re not going to . 
it ’ s the only way out ... 
I know . 
I think you ’ re one of the Bravest people I ’ ve ever met . 
... you should rest . 
then take me with you . 
I don ’ t want to be safe ! 
two . shaken not stirred . 
someone wants to kill me , I ’ d rather die looking him straight in the eye . what are you doing here ? looking for a woman a little more your type ? how about that one ? 
you had your chance , James . now I ’ m looking for a bigger thrill . 
really ? 
not at that price . time to surrender . 
shush . 
I used my body on the guards . it gave me control . I got to a gun and I took my chance . I ’ ve never told anyone that . 
a little . does it matter ? after all , what ’ s the point of living if you can ’ t feel alive ? isn ’ t that right , Elektra ? isn ’ t that your motto ? 
or did you steal it from your old friend Renard ? 
we had a run-in , he and I. He knew about us , he knew about my shoulder , he knew exactly where to hurt me ... 
you can drop the act , it ’ s over . 
I think you do . 
he used your exact words . 
you do what you have to do , but I ’ ve called in M. She ’ s en route from London even now . 
not interested . 
soon she ’ ll be everywhere . 
five more turns and your neck will break . 
you turned Renard . 
he killed me ! he killed me the day he refused to pay my ransom . 
it is my oil ! mine and my family ’ s ! 
no-one will believe this melt-down was an accident . 
oh James . 
yes . 
perhaps Sir Robert had a word with the Man Upstairs . 
you knew him well ? 
I ’ m sorry . 
indeed . 
not many people in this world have that kind of fortune . 
you think I fear death ? I welcome it . I get on my knees and pray for it . you , on the other hand , you have something to live for , no ? she ’ s beautiful isn ’ t she ? you should have seen her before . Flawless , and still so innocent , not such a whore in bed ... 
have you forgotten who saved your life in Geneva ? 
it ’ s I who should thank you -- for taking that money back to MI-6 . so distressing for M. An explosion inside her lair . 
you even brought the plane for us . we really couldn ’ t have done it without you . 
haven ’ t you heard the news ? so is she . 
which is neutral , no doubt . 
who did you get it from ? 
and we know how difficult that can be for the Swiss . 
your last chance . give me the name . 
I can ’ t tell you ... Alright , alright ! but you must protect me ! 
quite the opposite , in fact . 
since Oxford . I knew him when he had nothing but a brilliant mind and enough guts to conquer the world . he ’ s a man of great integrity . 
I ’ ve scheduled a medical for you . 
well , at least it turned out to have some purpose . 
caviar capital of the world . Matchless Beluga . firm , yet subtle . largest landlocked body of water on Earth . Oil-rich . Hitler wanted it . Stalin beat him to it . 
I took the initiative . 
I ’ m well aware of your stake in this , 007 . if you have a point , get to it . 
who ? 
Renard . 
sacrifice the girl to take out the terrorist ? 
the doctor who saved him couldn ’ t get it out , so Renard killed him . when Interpol found the X-rays , there was mild jubilation . Effectively , he ’ s a dead man . 
‘ That which does not kill me makes me stronger . ’ 
he ’ s not through yet . Renard doesn ’ t blow up five million dollars unless he knows there ’ s more coming in . he ’ s working for someone . someone who wants to stop the pipeline . and they hired the perfect killer . one with a vendetta against King ... and you . 
the worm on the hook again . 
then Robert was right about a Russian connection . 
is maybe ... the inside woman . 
I need you to pass me fit now , Molly . 
James . it wouldn ’ t really be ... 
perhaps after this ... test ? 
I could come for a second opinion ? 
yes . Viktor Davidov , Miss ... ? 
don ’ t know any doctor jokes . 
couldn ’ t make it . splitting headache . 
here ’ s your imposter . he ’ s paid off the men on the plane outside . they ’ re not taking the bomb to any Russian facility , they ’ re flying it wherever he tells them . 
so who are you ? 
when this is over our bodies may be blown to smithereens . 
then it ’ s no longer a bomb ? 
I did kill us . she thinks we ’ re dead . and she thinks she got away with it . 
it ’ s part of some plan . she dresses it up like a terrorist attack . the explosion covers up the theft of the plutonium . 
Elektra King . 
makes her look even more innocent . 
I was hoping you could tell me . 
she just upped the stakes . all her chips are on the table now . and M ’ s life is part of the bet . 
not just nuclear . powered by a nuclear reactor . he ’ s not loading any cargo . they want the sub . the sub itself . put weapons grade plutonium inside the sub ’ s reactor : instant , catastrophic meltdown . 
because an explosion like that would kill all the other pipelines . there would be only one way to get the oil out of the Caspian and pump it to the world ... 
Elektra would control it all . 
if I don ’ t get to the Boa before he gets to Maiden ’ s Tower , M is dead . 
we go down to the torpedo bay . 
he ’ s going to insert the plutonium . 
like riding a bike . 
just wanted to put him on edge ... 
but what if ... 
so isn ’ t it time you unwrapped your present ? 
but I still want one . 
this is a highly irregular procedure ! this is absolutely unprecedented ! 
-- ruined my exit ! 
uh - now , please don't be angry with me . I'll - I'll do anything you say , only ... only if you don't shout at me . it makes me nervous ! 
yes . 
well , I -- 
well , I -- 
well , I -- 
you promised us real things -- a real ... 
Th.D. ? 
well , you can't . as for you , my fine friend -- you're a victim of disorganized thinking . you are under the unfortunate delusion that simply because you run away from danger , you have no courage . you're confusing courage with wisdom . back where I come from , we have men who are called heroes . once a year , they take their fortitude out of mothballs and parade it down the main street of the city . and they have no more courage than you have . but ! they have one thing that you haven't got ! a medal ! therefore -- for meritorious .... 
it's empty . the tinsmith forgot to give me a heart . 
I'll see you reach the Wizard , whether I get a heart of not . Bee-hive -- bah ! let her try and make a bee-hive out of me ! you know -- hmm ? what's that ? 
no , sir ! 
we do . 
to Oz ! 
some -- but mostly lions , and tigers , and bears . 
I'd be clever as a gizzard -- 
a heart -- 
hurry -- hurry -- 
look -- you can see it here . it's wonderful ! 
Dorothy ! 
don't cry -- you'll rust yourself again ! 
I don't think I could , but we could try . 
yes . 
here , Tin Man -- help me . 
it's the wicked Witch ! what'll we do ? help ! help ! 
I can fairly hear my heart beating ! 
oh - look out . 
it's a whozis ? 
oh ! well , what happened to you ? 
well , that's you all over . 
now , now , don't fret . 
we'll get you together ! 
oh -- 
don't cry now . we haven't got the oil-can with us and you've been squeaking enough as it is . 
oh , no ! 
you put up a great fight , Lion . 
I don't know what we'd have done without you . 
go on ! 
yes -- how about Dorothy ? 
Ohhhh -- yes ... yes , sir -- Y-Yes , your Honor . you see , a while back , we were walking down the Yellow brick Road , and -- 
Ohhhhhh ! 
B-B-B-B-B-But if we do that , we'll have to kill her to get it ! 
Howdy , Miss Gulch . 
Dorothy ? well , what has Dorothy done ? 
you mean she bit you ? 
oh , she bit her dog , eh ? 
here -- here . go' way and let us alone ! 
why don't you try counting sheep ? 
Imposserous ! 
she - she can have my Witch Remover . 
hold still - hold still -- 
Whozat ? 
wait a minute . this is the left one . he walks bad enough already . 
yeah -- 
I hope your tail holds out . oh -- 
you don't neither -- 
yeah . 
not nohow ! 
don't you start it , too ! 
I'd show him who was King of the Fores' ! 
who at ? 
what's the matter ? 
somebody pulled my tail . 
I -- Oh -- 
what was that ? 
don't stand there talking ! put me together ! we've got to find Dorothy ! 
fine . he's got a plan 
yeah . me ? 
I -- I -- I -- I -- gotta get her outta there ? 
now ... 
stop pushing ! 
this way ! come on ! 
yeah ! 
you do ? boys , you're aiming low . you not only surprise , but you grieve me . 
ah -- 
yes . Dorothy -- ah -- DOR -- 
it did ? 
leave her alone ! 
the slippers -- yes ..... the slippers ! 
it's too late ! there they .... 
oh , rubbish ! you have no power here . be gone , before somebody drops a house on you , too . 
it's pleasant down that way , too . 
oh , well , here -- let me help you . 
Ohhhh -- 
Whhhooops ! Ha-ha -- there goes some of me again ! 
oh , no -- I just keep picking it up and putting it back in again . 
my , it's good to be .... 
oh ! oh ! Ohhh ! 
no , No -- I -- I just thought you hurt yourself . 
they would ? 
that's where I live . and I want to get back there so badly I'm going all the way to Emerald City to get the Wizard of Oz to help me . 
Um-hmm . 
I couldn't say . but even if he didn't , you'd be no worse off than you are now . 
but maybe you'd better not . I've got a witch mad at me , and you might get into trouble . 
I don't blame you for that . 
oh -- well -- you're not starting out very well . 
to Oz ? 
come along , Dorothy -- you don't want any of those apples . hmm ! 
oh -- 
what ? 
oil can ? oh -- oh , here it is ! 
here -- here -- 
oh , you don't think we're going to stand by and let her get away with fireballs and bees , do you ? 
I don't see how . you weren't around when I was stuffed and sewn together , were you ? 
of course , I don't know , but I think it'll get darker before it gets lighter . 
I don't see why not . why don't you come along with us ? we're on our way to see the Wizard now . to get him a heart . 
oh , no -- please . I have to rest for just a minute . Toto ! 
oh -- 
oh -- here quick -- oh ! - we'll oil him up . 
oh , he's been crying ! why have you been -- 
well , we'd better hurry if we're going to see the Wizard ! 
looks like we came a long way for nothing . 
did you just hear what I just heard ? 
Ohh ! OHH ! OHH ! 
I have so got brains . 
oh , hunk , you just won't listen , that's all . 
what's the matter -- gonna let a little old pig make a coward out of you ? 
no , but you tried to . 
well , you didn't have to go and hit me , did you ? is my nose bleeding ? 
you're right -- I am a coward . 
oh . 
the nerve . 
well , come on , then . what are we waiting for ? 
yes . 
look ! he's rusted again . oh , give me the oil can -- quick ! Oh-oh , quick ! 
hah ! 
in another hour , I'll be King of the Forest . long Live the King ! if .... 
not nobody , not nohow ! 
why , I'd thrash him from top to bottomamus ! 
I'd wrap him up in cellophant ! 
oh , well , then -- we'll ask him for you . 
but why ? why ? 
oh , come on . 
huh ? what'd he say ? 
no , but it's wonderful for threatening with . 
that noise don't come from no ordinary bird . 
are you gonna stand around And let' em fill us full of horror ? 
oh -- Oh -- Oh ! Toto -- Toto ! 
lion , darling -- I knew you'd come ! 
Ohhh ! 
oh -- oh -- they're all wonderful . 
stay with us , then , Dorothy . we all love you . we don't want you to go . 
well -- I would never've found it if it hadn't been for you . 
lions and tigers and bears ! 
lions and tigers and bears ! 
lions and tigers and bears ! 
lions and tigers and bears ! 
oil can ..... Oil can .... 
oil can .... 
my mouth -- my mouth ! 
oh ... 
... Oh , did that hurt ? 
oh , goodness ! how did you ever get like this ? 
my ... my neck . my ... my neck . perfect ? oh -- bang on my chest if you think I'm perfect . go ahead -- bang on it ! 
all hollow . oh -- 
I'm afraid I'm a little rusty yet . 
Emerald City ? why , that's a long and dangerous journey . and it might rain on the way . 
oh , but he will ! he must ! we've come such a long way already . 
I - I guess they tried to , but they bent their stingers . 
oh - I'll get it ! 
Oh-oh- 
still , I wish I could remember . but , I guess it doesn't matter anyway . we know each other now , don't we ? 
oh -- 
what sort of an animal is that ? 
I'm sure he could give you some courage . 
oh -- 
oh ! oh , Tin Man ! oh ! 
now come on - you're acting silly -- 
I knew you would ! 
you've had plenty of time already ! 
yes ... ! 
look -- it ticks ! 
oh -- Goodbye , Lion . you know , I know it isn't right , but I'm going to miss the way you used to holler for help before you found your courage . 
destroyed ? Toto ? oh , you can't ! you mustn't ! Auntie Em ! Uncle Henry ! you won't let her , will you ? 
no -- 
oh , no , no ! I won't let you take him ! you go away , you .... ! Oooh , I'll bite you myself ! 
stop her ! 
how did you guess ? 
why -- 
why , it's just like you could read what was inside of me . 
please , Professor , why can't we go along with you ? 
oh , no , I wanted to go along with you . 
nobody cares about me at home . they wouldn't even miss me . 
no , they won't - honestly . 
Auntie Em was even going to let them kill Toto yesterday for biting Miss Gulch . oh , please , Professor , why can't we go with you and see all the crowned Heads of Europe ? 
oh -- yes . 
yes ... That's Aunt Em . 
that's right . what's she doing ? 
oh -- 
me ? 
what's she doing now ? 
has it poppies on the wall .... 
I said it had poppies on the wall paper ! eh -- she's -- What's this ? why , she's -- she's putting her hand on her heart -- she's -- she's dropping down on the .... 
oh , no -- no ! 
oh , no , no , I have to get to her right .... 
but you couldn't have been , could you ? 
who , me ? why , I'm not a witch at all . I'm Dorothy Gale from Kansas . 
well , I'm a little muddled . the Munchkins called me because a new witch has just dropped a house on the wicked Witch of the East . and there's the house , and here you are , and that's all ... 
oh . but , if you please -- what are Munchkins ? 
I thought you said she was dead . 
no -- that's true . the only person who might know would be the great and wonderful Wizard of Oz himself ! 
no , I'm afraid I didn't . 
but , how do I start for Emerald City ? 
you don't need to be helped any longer . you've always had the power to go back to Kansas . 
whenever you wish . 
yes . say goodbye , Toto . 
all in good time , my little pretty -- all in good time . 
certainly -- certainly -- when you give me those slippers . 
very well ! throw that basket in the river and drown him ! 
that's a good little girl . I knew you'd see reason . 
I'm sorry . I didn't do it ! can I still have my dog ? 
catch him , you fool ! 
well , gee , I try and have a heart . 
sure . it's to break up winds , so we don't have no more dust storms . can you imagine what it'll mean to this section of the country ? I'll show you . it works perfectly now . here's the principle . you see that fan -- that sends up air currents into the sky . these air currents -- Oh , stop it ! 
who did it ? now wait a minute . 
now what happened ? I'll bet hunk did that . 
are you all right , Dorothy ? 
I don't believe you ! 
oh .... 
Ohhh ! 
oh ! come back ! don't go without me ! please come back ! 
oh -- 
tap - tap - tap - tap - What was that - that - that ? our echo - echo - echo . 
the Wizard - The Wizard - The Great and powerful Wizard of Oz - Oz - Oz-Oz - Oz - Oz - Oz - Oz ! 
please , sir . we've done what you told us . we've brought you the broomstick of the wicked Witch of the West . we melted her . 
yes , sir . so we'd like you to keep your promise to us , if you please , sir . 
do you presume to criticize the .... 
who are you ? 
you are ? 
but we've got to verify it legally To see ... 
if she ... 
is morally , Ethic'ly 
if any ! 
you'll be hist ... 
here , here , what's all this jabber-wapping when there's work to be done ? I know three shiftless farm hands that'll be out of a job before they know it ! 
I saw you tinkering with that contraption , Hickory . now , you and hunk get back to that wagon ! 
well , don't start posing for it now . here , here -- can't work on an empty stomach . have some crullers . 
I know , but we all got to work out our own problems , Henry . 
oh , I hope we got them in time . 
now , we can't go against the law , Dorothy . I'm afraid poor Toto will have to go . 
fifty-seven , fifty-eight -- 
Dorothy , please ! we're trying to count ! Fifty-eight-- 
oh , but he doesn't do it every day -- just once or twice a week . and he can't catch her old cat , anyway . and now she says she's gonna get the sheriff , and -- 
oh -- all right . 
no -- 
you wicked old witch ! Uncle Henry , Auntie Em , don't let' em take Toto ! don't let her take him -- please ! 
Dorothy . Dorothy , dear . it's Aunt Em , darling . 
yes , darling . 
there , there , lie quiet now . you just had a bad dream . 
no , Aunt Em -- this was a real , truly live place . and I remember that some of it wasn't very nice .... 
of course not . we're going to Baltimore . it's much nicer in Baltimore . 
no ... No . it is just the English way . 
they are English . they don't understand . 
I know . sleep now , Liebchen . 
lady , I'm here to help you . this man is very dangerous . an armed criminal . he's got a gun , hasn't he ? 
find Fergie , check the barns . I'll watch these two . 
my son is out there ! 
I don't think she knows . 
tight . but I'm working on him . 
they don't have any shit . 
all right , where is he ? 
he's from ... Ohio ... My cousin . 
John , lost control of himself . he ... will be repentant . 
yes . Samuel ! we're going . 
his name is John Book . 
no ... 
I know . 
we'll pray that he doesn't die ! but if he does , then we'll find a way so no one knows ! 
I know God help me , I know that , Eli . but I tell you that if he's found here , the people who did this to him will come for Samuel . 
eh ? well then , maybe he can go to Zook's barn-raising , eh ? see how good a carpenter . 
I have done nothing against the ordnung . 
I have committed no sin . 
that is idle talk . 
I am not a child . 
no ! they will be the judge of that ! and so will I ... if you shame me ! 
no , Rachel ... 
everything okay ? 
John said you're Amish . 
oh . 
you didn't have to ... 
Aganishish ? yeah , that sounds like John . 
you're not carrying a bullwhip ... how'd you manage to put my kids to work ? 
what's so funny ? 
God , Fred ... 
no ? why not ? 
listen , I don't know what's going on or how you got mixed up with him , but don't you let that self-righteous son of a bitch push you around , okay ? 
not yet . 
he accused John of taking kickbacks . and you know – anybody who knows John – knows that's a goddamn lie ! 
better you should get off my front porch before I get my mace ! 
I don't know where he is . 
wrong . 
probably . 
I admit I don't know where he is . 
what I know , Paul , is ... He's going to take you out ... 
I didn't even know about it . 
let's just find Coalmine . listen , Zenovich made a mistake . you didn't let anybody down . it happens – 
what the hell are you talking about ? what's happening . 
Johnny , what the fuck ? 
I hear you . 
Johnny ! where the hell have you been ? 
too hot . don't do it . don't come in . 
listen , Johnny , don't do anything stupid . you couldn't get within a mile of Schaeffer right now . so stay put ... Stay in touch – I'll let you know when maybe it makes sense . 
I hear you . I'll stay in touch . 
where I'm at is maybe 1890 . 
make that 1790 . 
Samuel . Samuel Lapp . but what happened here is none of his affair . my sister is expecting me ... our train is leaving soon . 
we're looking for a suspect . we've reason to believe he's still in the area . 
yes I do . your son is a material witness to a homicide . 
doesn't surprise me . I meet a lot of people like that . 
he wants to know who you are . your name . I told him we don't need to know anything about you . 
whacking ? 
believe me , I'm trying to get this over with as fast as I can . but Samuel will probably have to come back and testify . 
people who don't go into our courts when they're told to sometimes go directly into our jail . 
no you're not – You're glad , because now you've got a witness . I heard the other police talking last night . they don't seem to like you very much . 
I would not be too sure . 
what's a' good' tired . tired is tired . 
no . 
oh ? anything else ? 
listen , I'm the cop that polices the police . I'm not in the business of protecting crooked cops . I'll make an arrest when I know everybody involved . 
because – somehow – they knew I was getting close . look , it's narcotics ... They make dope out of chemicals ... they sell it on the street for millions of dollars . they'll do anything . and they can get away with it because they're cops . 
you'll be safe . you don't have to worry . 
you couldn't wait until morning ? 
I was wrong . 
I can't . 
no , no doctor ... 
gunshot ... they'll file reports ... they'll find me . 
the leadership of our district ... the diener . Bishop Tschantz is the one with no hair on top . they decided to come and see you for themselves . except Stoltzfus , of course . he came the first day . I think he saved your life . 
how long ? 
how long have I been here ? 
listen , thank you . thanks for everything . but I've got to go . 
nobody meant any harm . the boy was curious . I unloaded the gun - 
very interesting . I'm learning a lot about manure . what's that ? 
your husband's ? 
buttons are Hochmut . 
vain . proud . such a person is Hochmutsnarr . he is not plain . 
you make fun of me . like the tourists . driving by all the time . some even come into the yard . very rude . they seem to think we are quaint . 
no . I'd want a public phone . 
I'm going this morning . 
I know what he said . 
oh . the bullets . 
oh ? what happened to Hochstetler ? 
a real fireball . 
I did some carpentry summers when I was going to school . 
I can whack people . I'm hell at whacking . 
now hold on . there's a lot of people who think being a cop is a legitimate job . 
I'll drink some more of Stoltzfus' tea . 
not long ... A few days . 
I see . but I hope you have a lot of sugar . Eli is ready to go to Zook's . 
I'm leaving tonight . I'm going to need my clothes . and my gun . 
there was . 
I know . 
no . I was being unrealistic . even thinking about living this life . 
aren't you ? after today ? 
oh , come on , Rachel . no way . 
land ! are you crazy ? I'm no Amishman and I'm no farmer ! I'm a cop . that's what I know and that's what I do ! 
that's your way , not mine . 
well in the City of Philadelphia , God needs a little help ! 
where's my baggy pants ? 
oh , he's good . 
yeah . 
Zenovitch was about to deliver a list of names tonight – street chemists ... the guys processing this P2P into speed . 
maybe . 
maybe . 
if there isn't I've just wasted the last six months . 
the Amish boy saw him , Paul . I'll make it , but Set Donahue and the Homicide Department off my back or they'll blow the whole thing . 
well , anyway , don't get crazy . I'll do something for Zenovich's wife . 
I hope you don't have any doubts about that . 
who else knows ? 
okay , what are you going to need to clean it up 
maybe the Bureau . or those bastards at Treasury . I'll take care of it . I hate this shit , Johnny . you cut their balls off for me . I'm counting on you . 
a hot shower ... I haven't changed clothes in two days . 
just us . 
how bad did Mac get you ? we figured pretty bad . 
you might want to pass it along to Mac . 
I've already got something worked out . be seeing you . 
move ! or you die right here ! 
who'd you see ? 
no ... I saw the man who killed him . 
black ... I understand . what else , Sam ? 
no pistol . ever . 
okay , Mr. Book . 
you don't say . 
... I want to say a thing . 
it's them , Sam . now , Sam , listen to me and listen to me carefully . listen to me as you never listened before . 
listen to me , Sam ! I want you to go across the new corn to Stoltzfus' . run as fast as you can . and stay there ! 
I'll be all right . you just do as I say . 
I won't . now run . fast as you can ! 
got to , Sam . you and I are going to a courthouse together , put some people behind bars . 
sure have , Sam . 
I thought I was the English . 
it's been a while . 
pretty much . 
yes , sir . 
pick up the hat . 
sorry . it's important . 
upstairs , asleep . where'd you think ? 
that's none of your goddamn business ! so keep your goddamn holier-than- thou mouth shut ! anyway , they like Fred . 
who are these orphans , anyway ? 
John , I don't understand any of this . 
John , why ? ... 
maybe milking . 
cows . you know , cows ? 
good , you start tomorrow . 
guess I'm not used to so much . 
Queen Cherlindrea ? 
who ? ? 
no ! you let us handle this . come along , Rool ! 
take your time . don't worry about the elves . they won't come out here . 
hurry ! Queen Cherlindrea will know what to do . 
I can't see anything--she's too bright ! 
how do these work I wonder ? I got- ta save one to show the High Aldwin . 
the sorceress . 
without Raziel we'll never find Tir Asleen . we'd better go . 
Queen Bavmorda transformed her . 
shut up . 
she needs to be changed again . Sorsha crosses her arms in a hugg and watches as Willow changes the baby . soon the baby stops crying . re- lieved yet still anxious , Sorsha paces to a mirror . Willow rocks the baby gently , absently looking at the fire . then his eyes focus on the fire . 
Madmartigan . 
I don't know much about him . 
I know she's hungry . I tried to feed her but she wouldn't eat a thing . I'm not a wet nurse . 
Elves ! they're always tormenting babies . they make them cry and take their tears . 
he never misses . 
me neither ! 
yes ! Raziel ! she lives out on that island ! 
get back here , Rool ! 
I'm Willow Ufgood . I'm here to find fin Raziel . 
we need your help . to take this baby to Tir Asleen . she's a prin- cess . 
no ! 
a magician * makes * magic . any fool can use it . 
that's all I ever wanted ! 
what do I need for that ? 
till it's in a powder . the energy exits within you ... 
as below , so above . you hold the univers , Willow , in your hand . 
burn it to a fine Ash . 
patience . concentrate . you will find a way . 
I must concetrate my imagination ... to creat a new ... reality ! 
the limitless power of ... 
I can't remember all these things . what am I learning ? 
but what am I gonna transform ? ? 
that's the life spark . Exxence of magic and sorcery ! 
Shhhhh ! 
we need blood . to nourish the stone. charge the stone with ener- gy . 
his will . 
I just wanted to test it first . 
there's nobody here . 
use the philosopher's stone ! Hur- Ry ! Invocation ! release them ! 
more ! more ! 
you didn't transform them , Willow , you released them . that was noth- ing . now change me . 
why ? 
I've come all this way and now Elora Dana's going to die ! 
she's too powerful , Raziel 
surrender ! ! 
no , it's too big to be a Nelwyn baby . it looks like a daikini ... 
absolutely not . 
are you scared ? 
what a great son you are , Ranon . I wish I could take you with me . now go to sleep ... 
good . how long will it take ? 
you be careful . I'm a powerful sorcerer . I could turn you into a toad just like that . 
why . 
are you okay ? 
I don't know . 
Farmer . 
these burns . my arms . Ouch ... 
the greatest swordsman that ever lived . 
you hear trouble . 
friend of yours ? 
I hate this . 
you don't know anything about ba- bies . 
I will . 
absolutely ! 
of course ! I promise ! 
don't worry , Willow . she's in good hands . you haven't made a mistake . 
where the hell did you come from ? 
these Pecks make terrible nurse- maids . 
time to leave . 
I thought you had her ! 
Elora Danan ! 
I did ? 
yes it does . the Fairy Queen told me . 
my help ? a great magician like you ? you don't need any help . 
you ? 
I won't . 
the universe is a living creature , like you and me , Madmartigan . 
who ? 
she said lots of thing.s 
she asked about you , Madmartigan . 
you're crazy . I think you're in love . 
what are you gonna become , Raziel ? Queen of the rodents ? 
want me to carry Elora ? 
she can't be wrong . she's a very very very powerful sorceress . 
that's my fault , not hers . I've got to keep practicing . I'm still in the learning stage but magic , Madmartigan , requires concentration and-- 
ahhh ! 
Willow , this is war , not agricul- ture ! 
Madmartigan , you promised me you'd take care of Elora Danan like your own daughter . she is all that matters . are you going to abandon her ? 
he's no magician . 
I will ! but I need help ! 
Sorsha , Queen Bavmorda's daughter . 
as above , so below . 
can you use your magic to get our men into the fortress , Raziel ? 
no . I mean yes . 
let me see it . 
why not ? 
you're not a woman . 
my step-father's going to tear you apart . 
too bad you're not more like your father . 
I'm not going to let this baby die . 
I love you . 
I don't believe you . 
Madmartigan . 
not today , Willow . 
my family found this baby in the river , High Aldwin . 
if I'm not strong enough to be your apprentice , how can I do this ? 
I don't want courage . I don't want to be a warrior . all I've ever wanted was to do magic , real magic , like you ! 
waste magic on revenge ? you have much to learn , Willow ... 
yes ... ? 
she belongs to all of us . she is the future queen and ruler of all kingdoms on earth . 
me ? 
what is Tir Asleen ? 
you are very important , Willow . 
anything you hurl them at will turn to stone . 
he thought you were a woman , Airk ! 
nothing you wouldn't have done it my place ! 
least I'm not down there herding sheep ! 
hey , remember ? you don't need my help , Madmartigan . little rabbit trap like this ? come on ! I could open it for you , but I wouldn't wanna insult you ! 
you managed alright . 
they're not after me . they want the baby . 
then come with us . 
just get me some horses . 
thought you might get lonely , mad- martigan ! 
let's go . 
they're coming . 
they're rounding up a posse . figure an hour ? 
hey ... ! 
well , come on , that's half a dozen armed men ... 
gotta get the Doctor someplace safe . 
we'll explain on the way . 
who was this partner of his ? 
a glass eye ? that's who it was ! one-eyed Jack Garrison . otherwise known as General Garrison , Confederate Third Army . I saw him at Dr. Loveless' party , but I couldn't place him . he used to wear an eye-patch . 
for the moment . but I fear not for long . I'm of no use to him now . 
he's just full of plans that aren't gonna work out . 
now it's a bomb . 
you don't know what he's built ? ! surely you don't think he kidnapped all those geniuses to have them make something as rudimentary as this . 
when you're three and a half feet tall , sir , life turns you into a comedian whether you like it or not .... Come with me , won't you ? 
thank you . I confess to a preoccupation with acquiring precisely that which the world says I cannot have . 
no , sir ... just a businessman . 
I deal with some tough customers . 
how embarrassing . did I hold up three fingers ? 
talk ? about what ... ? oh ! about who you are and all that ? 
restrain yourself , Voltaire . he's just the sort of coward who would shoot an unarmed giant . 
he had a pressing engagement . 
you got that right . now get up . we're walking out of here . 
has it penetrated yours that I'm holding a gun on their leader ? 
exactly ! you are on foreign soil . you are a representative of the occupying forces . or haven't you checked a map lately ? ! 
that would be ... the Mexican War ? 
" Emperor Miguelito ... ? " 
well , your highness , what makes you think we'll ever sign a treaty with you ? 
so , I'm the only one here who can tell the difference between an Emperor and a murderer ? 
that'll be all , boys . 
this is Colonel Richards . 
exactly . any number of nations would love to cripple our scientific growth . and what better way to tip the scales in their favor than by killing off the greatest minds this country has produced . 
nicely said , sir . 
and now the job's yours . 
on my way to Denver ... 
he didn't . that's your job . I'm taking you off that other case until you've nabbed this lunatic . good luck . nice train . but mine's nicer . 
well , yes sir . a Professor Morton , but with just a little more time , sir , I can assure you a breakthrough on this case ... 
of course , sir , that's why I've assigned a new man . and he's no ordinary Marshal . he's quite sophisticated . three college degrees . a master of disguise . speaks French ... 
yes sir . 
why surely , Mr. President , there must be some mistake . I mean ... 
well , Captain , then the answer is your train is still here . 
private train ? 
I would , Mr. Doyle ! are you game ? 
I get that feeling . you know , Mr. Tyler , I'm the kind of woman who doesn't believe men are much more than a complete waste of time . but after spying you across the room , I'm tempted to suspend my disbelief , at least for the evening . 
I don't recollect ever being compared to a pistol before . 
really ? 
my ... the wild west . 
your guests , ma'am ? 
you most certainly do . 
I don't like to lose , either . 
you tell me . 
thank you . but the truth is , I'm a single woman in a man's world . that leaves me very few choices , doesn't it ? 
would that include me ? 
you've ... done ... this ... before . 
really ? like General Garrison or didn't you hear all that shooting ? 
you bring the best out in a man . 
fine , I'll stop . 
we'll see . 
here . Mr. Tyler . he claims a certain skill at handling firearms . 
well , let's help them with that . take the legs . 
yes , me ! 
well , see , he had this little wagon when he was a kid ... 
like hell ! I'll see it through ! Ram the bastard ! 
Jim West . 
I don't mind him , but who the hell are you ... my valet or something ? 
funny . so am I. 
your train ? listen , friend , you're obviously lost . ... I've got orders here to take possession of this train and to investigate a certain crime . 
just another bureaucratic foul-up . you know how these pencil-pushers are . so , why don't you just run on back and explain what happened ? 
you're quite the wordsmith , fiddle boy . but nobody smooth-talks his way into my assignment . 
wouldn't dream of it . 
put them all together and what do we have ? 
then why kidnap them ? why not just kill them ? 
" gadget guy ? " while I may not be in a league with these unfortunate geniuses , I am , sir , in my own humble way , a man of science . 
you need that real often ? 
no offense , but all I ever need ... Are these ... And this . 
try what ? 
well ... it's the only one I have . it's gotten me out of quite a few tight spots ... 
I'll work on it . 
Aha ? 
is this leading somewhere ? 
starting with a screw ? 
what about the explosive ? 
Limestone quarry , Southern mansion . easy to get them mixed up ... I say we invite ourselves to the party . 
prepare what ? 
call me that again , and you're going to find a boot where it doesn't belong . 
quite . come , let's mingle . 
whoa , Jim . maybe . but we can't arrest this little pillar of society on maybe . 
almost ? 
you feeling all right ? 
good , I wasn't sure you were up to it . 
all what ? 
that ? oh , it's a kind of Chinese fighting ... I was sort of caught once with a lovely Chinese girl out in San Francisco . her big brothers were kind enough to teach it to me I've got a book on it , if you're interested . 
and if they've got Dr. Loveless building weapons like those flying bombs ... they just might do it . 
I'm going to hit you . 
hey , I tried the board . 
at least the thing's not that fast . we just follow it . whenever it stops , we're there , waiting . 
no , I'm not all right . they got away . and we can't even follow them . they can get off the tracks anywhere they want . 
so ... spontaneous . all that leaping off buildings and Chinese fighting and whatnot . 
well ... that , too . 
so ... what happened ? 
uh ... how long ago was this ? 
I thought all you needed were your fists and your gun . 
I find most criminals slip up somewhere ... 
you really enjoy yourself , don't you ? 
sure . we have no idea what's going on . 
come on , let's at least see if we can find Dr. Pemberton . 
sure . it's a wind-up ... thing . 
shhh ! come on . tell us something ! 
it's better than nothing . 
yes . and a much nicer one than ours . 
it's not a guy ... 
we oughta get a couple of those rockets . Voom ! we're there before we left ! 
this ? I'm testing a new spirit gum , to see how it holds . 
my disguises have helped me solve many a difficult case . I spent three years on the stage , you know . remind me sometime to regale you with my Lear . 
I adjusted it . 
oh , no , we split him fifty-fifty . 
not likely . there must be tracks of twenty different wagons . freight wagons , carriages , buckboards ... 
oh , thank you . 
Artemus , you ready for this ? his next target is Albuquerque . 
I know ! I know ! 
we've got to stop him right here , now ! with that armored steam engine of his it'll be a slaughter . 
there's only seventy-eight . 
well , hell , maybe we do have a chance . 
of course not . 
that's ... that's the criminal mind about to stomp our sorry butts ! 
where have you been ? 
oh , I see , an easy plan ! 
he was going to shoot me ! do you mind ? ! 
in the next two minutes ? 
what is this ? a whole new train ? 
hi , Sandy . 
can't . got a passenger . 
I'll bet . look , Sam . why don't you come by this weekend . we'll take the boat out ... 
what ? running over alligators with that silly swamp jalopy when you could be sailing a real boat ... 
listen , Kelly skipped school . have you talked to her ? 
didn't you see her this morning ? 
so maybe I'm a one-woman man . 
goodbye , Sandra . 
Jesus . two million one hundred thirty-three thousand three hundred thirty-three and change . 
put Kelly on too . 
shut up . don't fall apart . the only people who can blow this is us . remember ? 
good . just keep telling yourselves that , the only people who can fuck this up is us . 
are you mad at me ? 
the guy was history when he killed Kelly . you knew that . 
but then it is better this way , don't you think ? no loose ends . 
that was the same thing Ray said . 
yeah , real funny . you're wrong about this , I could get busted on the spot . 
we ? 
Walter . he's been aimin' that Brownie through knotholes for years . I saw these , I knew he'd finally struck gold . I can't decide which came out better , that little straw Kelly's got up her nose , or that vibrator you've got up her ass . what do you think , Mr. Lombardo ? 
story's the same , Detective ... 
the one you bought at school . 
in cutoffs , a wet T-shirt . 
and she wanted to talk . 
but you can't tell us what she wanted to talk about . 
and she began to cry . and you put an arm around her . 
that's right . 
it is and I don't . ordinarily ... But , I mean ... there's this kid standing in front of you crying ... 
fuck you . this is bullshit . I'm outta here . 
the bitch shot me , is what happened . 
well , shit , you're the cop , they don't teach you to disarm people , shoot them in the leg or something ? you weren't supposed to kill her for Christ's sake . 
Kelly was supposed to be framed , not killed . what I'm telling you is , I don't like surprises . 
yes , we call it a winch . and these are shrouds , and these are stays . 
come on , man . I'll make a sailor out of you yet . 
Jesus , man ... You okay ? 
come off it , man ... It was an accident . 
I did . at Blue balls . 
so Suzie , you called us , remember ? 
will they ? 
then he'll be back at Blue balls ? 
you got something against cigarettes ? 
well , you're half right . best thing you could do for yourself right now would be to talk to me . 
every triangle I've ever seen never lasts . somebody's got to go . 
you , Kelly , Sam . 
is that what you think ? you have friends ? is that what they told you ? 
Suzie , Suzie ... This is me , Ray , you're talking to . we both know you don't have shit , never have had shit , never will have shit ... 
don't you see what this means ? you really think Sam and Kelly are gonna give you a third of the money ? you , the pill-head with the rap sheet ? 
that's right . that was his name . 
shoulda , coulda , woulda ... Get him in the water . 
hey , Ray . guess whose name is on the numbered bank account besides yours and Sam's ? 
that's right . 
detective Duquette , Ms. Van Ryan . let me in . now . 
where she lives . in the guest house . now will you tell me what this is about ? 
you can't ... 
Ken . I'm in some trouble . I need an attorney and you're the only one I know . so I figured I'd start here . 
you can tie whoever did it to Sandra Van Ryan ... 
lady has some deep pockets . that's all I'm saying . 
for you to be getting this kind of heat , for what they have on you ... It doesn't add up . Sandra Van Ryan's got' em running scared . and I'll tell you something else , you rush , you get careless . 
sound nice ? it's a fucking drug rehab farm . it's where Kelly Van Ryan went when her morn fished her out of the swamp . meanwhile , you get educator of the year I mean there's no way they can put this thing in front of a jury . shit , they haven't even taken your statement yet . reason ? they're still shoveling dirt and my guess is , they're coming up empty . now tell me I'm right . 
good . so what we're going to do is march right to Hunter's doorstep . we're going to insist they take a statement . we're going to tell them to charge your ass or get off your back . they're walking a fine line here . Defamation of character , malicious prosecution ... 
fair enough . let's go make a statement . 
I was just thinking about where I'm gonna stay . I lost the house . it's like waking up from a goddamn nightmare . 
just like that ? 
okay , try me on Sunday . I'm going out to the Everglades on Saturday . you guys can wash the mud off . 
in back of the garage . 
jeez , that thing ... Can't you ... 
all right . I'll have to look for it . 
drop dead ... You know where my mom is trying to get the money to pay you off ? she's trying to break my trust . how do you like that ? I can't touch it until she's dead and she won't give me a dime and now she's trying to break it to pay you ... 
about six and a half million dollars . 
of course I'm crazy . ask my mom . 
do it to ourselves ? 
stick ? 
yes . 
why can't you come ... 
then do it . I need you on this Kelly . do it tonight . we'll figure something out ... Okay ? 
okay . I want you to hear this too . we've got to be cool . all of us . people think I'm rich , for Christ's sake . I'm doing what rich guys do . I'm spending my money . it's more suspicious if I sit around doing nothing . now don't let this cop fuck with your minds . 
there was no way . that cop would've gotten her to tell him ... everything . she was weak and dumb ... 
hello . 
I can't help it . he gives me the creeps ... I mean why was Suzie so scared of him ? she's not that way . I think he did something ... 
I don't know ... I think it was something else ... Suzie says the bust was bullshit ... 
I don't know . I want to see you ... 
but what if they find out ... God , they'd put you in the gas chamber ... 
okay . I love you too . 
that's not your line . 
no little girl can ever make me come . 
you think that's wise ? 
hi , Mon . 
Whichever one I want . 
you notice my new jumper ? 
I would hardly say you look like trash . 
I miss Dad . 
no you don't . 
he ... Sam Lombardo ? 
I'm here to congratulate my friends and their children . I'm leaving again tonight . 
where , the mall ? 
you all gonna go down to the Caribbean together ? 
you're out of your mind . 
I'm not on your property ! 
yeah , but he can't push you around like he can me . you've got family and they've got clout . with we it's different ... with me ... 
man , I wanna smoke a joint . 
I'm scared , that's what . I'm scared there's no one to trust . 
oh , for Christ's sake . 
are you retarded , or just brain dead from whiffin' fumes out there in the swamp ... 
what brain ? 
nothing . 
I think we just need to get wasted . 
shit . 
you and Suzie used to come out here together ? 
Lombardo ever come out here ? 
no . but I mean ... just the idea that Mr. Lombardo would ... 
yeah , but ... 
no ! 
hey , man , at least in study hail I could meditate . 
what ? 
yeah . but I got my bike . 
yeah ... okay ... he did 
I wanna go home now . 
shit , what difference does it make ... Nobody's gonna believe me anyway ... 
okay ! he did . he pushed me to the floor and he did it to me . now , can I go home ? 
I'm sorry ... you said it hurt ? why ? 
I said he did . 
this wasn't my idea . 
he was my friend at first . then I got busted ... he didn't even stick up for me . I had to go away to that hellhole . it's like , you're his favorite , then who cares ? you wanna know something ? when Kelly said we should do this , I thought cool , all these big shots screwing me over , like that cop , Duquette . now they're gonna get screwed . 
not that stuff about her running away , him trying to find her . that's bullshit . 
we've got three . guy mowing his yard , couple of kids playing hoops . 
you heard Kelly say " Sam . " that was Lombardo on the phone . and you saw the girls ... 
I don't believe I'm hearing this . a month ago you were pulling these two apart at the courthouse . they were acting . they were all acting , from the beginning . and we bought it , hook , line and sinker ... And now they're home free with six million of Sandra Van Ryan's money . 
you think this is just about money , about us looking foolish ? question him . you're gonna find a stone cold manipulative psychopath . and those girls are going to wind up dead ... 
get off this Ray , now . if there is any evidence here , it's for Homicide . you get an ID , you call me . 
just tell us what happened . 
bit , scratched . but I had her pinned . she calmed down . I was going to cuff her ... She said she thought she was going to be sick . she asked to use the bathroom . 
you didn't cuff her ? 
Suzie Toller's . and that's the only thing saving your sorry ass . 
I think she's acting . I think she set it up to be alone with him because she wanted him to come on to her . I think maybe she's upset that he didn't ... 
where's this coming from ? 
you know what that will mean for Lombardo . 
yeah , maybe , a little . 
we need to tape the interview , Suzie . no one will see it but us . now when was this , that Mr. Lombardo gave you the ride ? 
yeah . 
no . 
yes . 
I guess . 
no . he stopped by himself . okay ? that's all . let me go . 
what was that ? 
back to the land of grownups . 
all I'm saying is , I think we should go slow here . 
hunter's making it our job because Sandra Van Ryan's got a bug up his ass . you know that as well as I do . we're gonna trash this guy's life and I keep asking myself if it's really necessary . 
still doesn't explain why he couldn't catch up with her . I mean how long does it take to put on a shirt ? 
you're telling me you believe the guy ? 
yeah , well , Van Ryan got his . I don't imagine he gives a shit now . 
this is where she lives . she wants to talk . beats the shit out of me why she would call me at all . I busted her once for possession. she wound up doing about six months at Camp Nine . 
Lombardo's settlement ? 
maybe Lombardo's attorney was saving the affair for the trial . 
unless what ? 
the job looks okay to us . but look at it from his point of view . the man's surrounded by wealth and privilege . but for him ... it's just a reminder of what should have been his . 
this one's got you working overtime , hasn't it ? 
eliminate the competition . 
where'd you come up with this stuff , anyway ? 
which she might have saved , if she hadn't set out to destroy the man's life . 
you could say that . 
we all have ... 
I'm gonna take you back to the office . will you put out a call on Suzie's car for me ? 
two kids could've gotten into a fight , lost a couple of teeth . 
where's the body ? 
her grandmother said she'd been threatening to run away . and I found the car at the Miami bus terminal . 
we don't know that , Ray ... 
Ray , you heard him ... 
if I'm wrong about those teeth -- it's a promise . 
where's Lombardo ? 
the blood type on the rocks matches Suzie's . 
if old pictures interest you , come back some time , there's quite a collection down in the pagoda . I'll see you get a proper tour . 
no . 
how long ? 
maybe she used another name . 
I don't know what to say ... 
Suzie ? 
I just want to get it over with . my mom's making me do this . I just want to forget it . 
take your time . 
he said something like , " Do you want it dirty7 " or something . I tried to turn away , but he pushed me to the floor . 
yes . I said stop . I screamed . I mean that's how it sounded in my head . he hurt me ... 
no . I've done it a couple of times , I mean with guys I dated . but this hurt ... like , he was built ... you know ... 
then what ? 
you mean he withdrew ... 
try , Kelly . 
what if something distracts it and it snaps anyway ? 
about Suzie ? 
he used to come around here . he had a thing going with one of the girls over at the Glades . 
she still work there ? 
was there ever any kind of investigation ... 
and the child ... 
Suzie . then you're not her grandmother ... 
so Suzie and Sandra Van Ryan were half- sisters . 
I'm fine . nice TV . 
we can get blood type right away . dental records will take longer . you want DNA , that can take weeks . 
the teeth doin' any talkin' ? 
what about the blood ? 
second you get something on those teeth , I want it 
eat a power bar . 
Kelly . 
senior class fund-raising gig . I told' em they could hose down the Jeep . hey , come on . it's for a good cause . 
thanks . 
and where might that be ? 
I love Antigua . maybe I'll come visit you . 
Kelly Van Ryan ... 
Sam ... I ... Sandra Van Ryan's been on the horn with every member of the school board all day long . she's pushing for suspension ... 
that's great . I'll just tell my creditors I'm not a rapist . no problem ... Shit . I can't believe the board's going to act without even hearing my side of it . 
I was in the middle of a melodramatic exit . it wouldn't really make a statement if I tiptoed out the door ... What are you selling ? 
people pay good money for that ? 
oh no . no way . I've had all the bad news I can take for one day . 
I'm terrible at this . I blurt . I'm a blurter . your parents ... They ... well ... they exist no further . Skinny-dipping . the Amazon . Piranhas . it wasn't pretty . 
well kid , I'm speaking of ... your biological parents . 
it's spring break . I don't want to go to a will reading . 
I'm seventeen . I know it like the back of my hand . 
smashing ! welcome to the family , Ted . you are going to breathe some new life into this place . you are going to set the world on fire ! you are going to ... call me Uncle Billy ? please ? 
I have only one concern ... 
a lot ? I mean , a whole lot ? 
you're sure ? 
seldom ? no kidding ? 
indeed it is . during the day , visitors prefer to be outside , au naturel . as it were . 
I ... uh ... I think she's doing fine on her own . 
yeah . everything's cool . 
just a couple of finishing touches . my parents always said you never get a second chance to make a good first impression . 
truth is , I'm a little nervous . 
huh ! you laugh in the face of pressure ! 
you are a multi-media magnate . the Tycoon of Tits . the Baron of Bottoms . 
me ? the King of coitus ? 
whoa . but ... that's the thing ... I've never even actually ... 
I was like a different person tonight . 
I would have been laughed right out of Xenia . 
it's really going to be strange going home in a couple of days . 
really ? you'd do that for me ? 
you seem like you're anything but lazy , Uncle Billy . 
my parents always say hard work builds character . 
what kind of ideas ? 
you think we should be more open minded ? 
in other words , our scope is too narrow . 
that's perfect . 
I'm Ted Nelson . I guess you already know that part . for two years I've been the editor of the high school paper in Xenia , Ohio . I've won some awards , made a difference . I've always had journalism in my soul . now I know why . 
really ? so I'm doing OK ? 
he was in a league of his own . 
I can't wait to see the pictures . 
such enthusiasm . have I told you lately how proud I am of you ? 
you're taking this bull of an empire by the horns , but you're still keeping your small town values . you're not letting all this " stuff " spoil you . 
I wish I knew you years ago , when my brother was alive . I wish he never gave you up . 
you're right . I should work , too . our first issue together is almost ready to print . 
you're a great kid . don't you forget it . 
we've got a huge problem with the magazine , Ted-baby . our readers hate it . hate IT . we need to talk . 
--PEACHES ! canned peaches ! 
my job . back off , Benedict . 
all is fair in " Heaven , " Ted-baby . 
aw , come on , kid . throw me a bone . I'm your uncle for gosh sakes . 
thanks , Principal Merkin . 
yes , sir . I'll brace myself . 
you think I ought to just tell them thanks but no thanks ? I don't want your silly billion dollar empire ? 
are you kidding ? this magazine is my dream . it's every red-blooded , heterosexual male's dream . 
what kind of sick question is that ? I'll be watching you , young man . your money and power mean nothing here . nothing . 
we cannot afford free speech if it excises the moral fiber of this community ! 
rules are rules . 
deaf ears , Mr. Nelson . I answer to a higher power . 
a statue in front of city hall , dedicated to Principal Dick Merkin ? 
a new pediatric wing at the hospital ? a presidential campaign ? name it . anything . 
Mr. Nelson , you disappoint me . first you break our school board rules . then you break the law . 
our state has a zero tolerance policy for underage drinking . 
alcohol does horrible things to a developing young mind . 
no cursing in this house , young man . use the strong vocabulary God gave you . 
Charlie , at a will reading ? what did I do to deserve this ? 
did you have a nice flight ? are they taking good care of you ? 
save it , honey . we want to hear every detail when you get back , but we don't want you to run up Mr. Zukerman's phone bill . 
what is all this ? when are you coming home ? 
everything is lovely , Ted , but much too expensive . 
only the best for my mother . 
I'll make you very proud . 
but how would we pay our bills ? 
oh . goodness . 
like what ? 
forget the store . think big . 
oh , Teddy . we missed you so much . 
that's just one example . my reporting has made a difference . 
is it true ? is ignorance bliss ? 
don't even tell me you're hot for Miss titty Pom Poms over there . 
I didn't know they gave them for Best Lip gloss Retention during a Blow Job . 
go ahead . ask her to the prom . get it over with . 
--Do it . I triple-dog-dare you . 
but you triple-dog-dared me . 
what is it , William Randolph ? your balls need scratching ? 
in what sense ? 
ah ha ! it was so well hidden , you didn't even know it was there . 
just because someone died and made you king of the publishing world doesn't mean you're even one ounce smarter than you were a week ago . 
I'm still better than you . nothing changed except the decimal point in your savings account . 
then I'll write about YOU . 
" local boy inherits more money than god . " call me crazy , but I smell human interest . 
I don't get the distinction . 
I felt limited . I felt confined . I felt like I was suffocating . 
I guess . 
you never know around here . 
is this an gritty exposé or a candy ass press release ? 
life must be peachy on Planet Ted . 
my adoptive grandfather . who knows what my biological grandfather did . 
considering this is your first time on a private jet , on which you are interviewing the world's most eligible bachelor , you are extremely cavalier . 
see ? you're impertinent , rude , sarcastic . 
a little respect would be nice , that's all . 
you're so twitterpated you don't even see the miner's hat and the pickax . 
you've got enough people kissing your ass . 
put your eyeballs back in your head , William Randolph . I'm on assignment . a girl has to fit in . 
to the best hiding place in the world . 
he didn't . he had it built . 
not " whatever . " it's two different things . 
he phoned it in . 
now it makes sense , the whole Neo Bohemian , down with hypocrisy , fight the power crap . you're a poor little rich girl . 
you think my dad would have been like that if I knew him ? you think he would have bought me a stadium , instead of teaching me how to play ball ? 
I mean my father . 
it's all so complicated . 
I feel like I'm being drawn and quartered . like every part of me is being pushed and pulled and tugged in a different direction . 
and then what ? 
you're amazing . 
even when you infuriate me , I still want to kiss you . 
if we were a team , we could do anything . I mean , anything . 
in a word : MERK . exposed . 
there's gotta be something . we have to dig deeper . 
he shut down your paper ! you're stuck writing articles about swap meets and raffles and PTA brunches ! 
then you won't mind covering that watermelon seed spitting contest next week ... 
well ? where the hell are you ? 
let's do it . 
you expected whips , chains , Merk being cattle-prodded by some dominatrix in a leather hood ? 
amen to that . 
I'm trembling with excitement . 
my desire betrays me , like goosebumps on my flesh . 
I figured you for more of a hairy armpit guy . 
wearing them ? or humping them ? 
that's refreshingly deviant . 
I'm very aural . 
sounds , voices , music , humming . all of it can turn me on , or off , like a switch . 
I had a Portuguese boyfriend who could read the phone book and melt me . 
you live and learn . I realized the most important thing to me , above all , is trust . 
you lose trust in someone and it's over , done , gone , forever . 
not a chance . 
trust is something you earn , over time . you don't just inherit it overnight like a gazillion dollar empire . 
maybe someday . 
that's hard to believe . 
I know , their small town mentality can be maddening . 
aw Julie , it's my job . it's like being a doctor . 
you've seen one naked breast , you've seem them all . 
you're quick . I like that . 
the thing is , I made a commitment . I said I'd do it and I have to keep my word . 
I'm not going anywhere , Ted . you're the one with the champagne wishes and caviar dreams . 
the thing is , I'll need a first mate . 
I know where you can find an excellent editor-in-chief . 
let your fingers do the walking . 
you better . 
why can't we have pot roast or stroganoff or even a little London broil ? I mean , for god's sake , we own a grocery store ! 
you can call me Jimmy again . Sheryl Petersen said James sounds too pretentious . 
she knew exactly where you were staying , which you neglected to tell me , your own brother . 
most places are , Jimmy . 
so , what brings you here at his hour ? 
very funny . 
my room ? 
it's not up to me . 
you can have it , then . I'm not going back there . 
you want it in writing ? 
that's it ? I mean , you don't want to order room service or anything ? we could play games and watch movies and stuff . 
are they okay ? 
I miss them , too . 
you're a peach . 
he was my Grandfather , too . 
that's a crappy thing to say . 
you ever look down on them again and call them " grocers " like it's a dirty word , and you'll be sucking your filet mignon through a straw for six to eight weeks . got it ? 
from my wise , albeit youthful , vantage point , the world is your oyster . you scored big . 
well , Jay . they've been exceptionally supportive . 
I'm no stranger to the notion of philanthropy . Andrew Carnegie has long been one of my idols . 
matter of fact , Jay , my uncle and I are planning to rethink the magazine . to expand the traditional western notions of " beauty . " 
we'll send you the release forms , Ted . our staffers will help in any way they can . 
look , the girls of Xenia are gorgeous , you'll see . next month we'll be back to normal . 
you mean they knew who I was ? 
giving you up was the most unselfish thing they ever did . when they founded " Heaven , " they wished they could take you back but it was too late . all they could do was build the empire , knowing that someday it would all be yours . 
your parents would be crushed to think you weren't happy with it . 
I understand . 
but how can you respect yourself if you don't ? 
but don't worry ... we'll be in heaven . the REAL heaven , I mean . not that heaven is an actual place , but more like a state of being . or not being . who knows . maybe we know now . 
but we did want you . it's just that you don't always get to keep what you want . we knew you needed a real mom and dad . 
can you believe that was me ? 
so here we are . dead . but we never want you to want for anything . that is , we want you to have everything . 
they're in the ignition , silly . 
I don't have much experience with a ... uh ... stick . 
got it . 
I don't even know if I should be doing this . it's a very expensive car . 
some of them have to be automatics . 
I'm Ted , by the way . I think I forgot to say that . 
the one with the horses . 
I almost didn't recognize you without ... you know ... that stallion between ... your ... uh ... legs . 
shopping , really ? I should tell my friend . 
hi ho , Silver . 
what do you mean ? I'm Ted Nelson . 
I always knew there was more . I felt it . 
hmmm ? 
whatever you want . 
what do you want me to do ? 
hang in there , I'll think of something . 
I guess ... I don't know ... I guess we should leave if we're not wanted . 
it's my private business ! mine ! 
Dad , please . 
you're way ahead of me again ? 
the lesson being ? 
I'm getting so good at this . 
of course we are . 
son . 
they had a rough life . your father was a bouncer . your mother was , well , a two-bit stripper . there was no place for a baby . 
they did do one great thing . they gave us our boy . 
be a sport . how bad could spring break in Los Angeles be ? 
think of it as a rite of passage to manhood . 
whatever helps you cope . 
there ya go . always remember , focus on the peach ... 
just say it , Dad . 
Dad , let's just say I can buy anything I want in the whole bookstore . including the bookstore . 
we're grateful , Ted . it's not that . those craftsman tools ... they're a dream come true . 
consider me your fairy godfather , except without the fairy part . no more mealy apples and bruised bananas , ever , for the rest of your lives . 
your mom said you've been ignoring your chores . 
you ordered a Winnebago ? 
watch your tone , mister . 
I will not have my boys arguing . 
we own a small family grocery store . 
of course , dumpling . its very nice of Ted but ... 
I always wanted craftsman tools . he even got me the limited edition Buckeye colors . 
we love our lives just the way they are . 
but that doesn't make you the boss of everything , son . 
we miss you . we miss our son . 
we want you to go to college , find a career you love , marry a nice girl from a nice family , and live happily ever after . 
from your lips , to God's ears . 
well . the prom's coming up . 
and I was wondering . 
if you don't have ... I mean ... 
shut UP ! are you serious ? of course I will ... of course . 
you like me . I like you . I guess it's pretty obvious to everyone . 
but that smile . 
so you'll think about it ? 
the answer is NEVER , Ted , NEVER . except maybe in your dreams . 
yeah ? you like ? 
I turned eighteen over spring break . I'm eligible . 
I do ? I mean , yeah , I do . 
do it ? 
I remember the first time you walked into Mrs. Temple's class in 2nd grade . blue gingham dress . blond ponytail . 
that was code for " I like you . " 
things change . now I'm taking off my clothes ... all by myself . 
you have changed since second grade . 
you expect me to think at a time like this ? there isn't a drop of blood in my brain . 
come on , I was hamburger . you were porterhouse . 
God , you are so hot . 
we reinvented ourselves . 
you've obviously never had your dogs nestled in thousand dollar Italian loafers . 
jealousy is so unattractive . 
he kicked major ass and you know it . 
this is a fun place ... but we don't usually come here until after the orgies . 
oh , god . look . look . 
if it isn't straight by now , son , you probably should see a doctor . 
we don't generally feature blow-up dolls in our magazine . but hey , if you think there's a market for it . 
you and your pep talks . 
that's Charlie . my best friend . he's into beef analogies , partly because he's a butcher's son , and partly because , well , he's just into beef analogies . what can I say ? he's also a photographer ... 
that vibe is from your wrist , pal . you've been over-tenderizing your meat , again . 
she smiles at everyone , Ted . she's like a newborn with gas . 
were you always this sick ? 
someday , I'll find out . 
I defy your hamburger theory of life , and all of the unfulfilled hopes and dreams it represents . 
I defy any and all limits . 
any time , any day , a man can completely reinvent himself . 
poor Freud , turning in his grave . 
nobody knows about your mental retardation . 
and nobody knows you're a virgin ! aw , who are we kidding ... 
Astronomical . 
well , Dad said ... 
maybe he got promoted . 
cut it out , before you break something ! 
wait a second , I thought we were hamburger guys . 
perv . 
be cool . fake it if you have to . 
oh . well . maybe not yet . 
so far away ? in Xenia ? 
I better go , Dad . 
what is it now ? 
don't tell me . another vision of incomparable beauty ? 
I get it now . you and me . we're dead . 
our plane crashed . in the Grand Canyon . a big fiery explosion . we never made it to L.A. They needed dental records to identify us . and this place . this . actually . is . heaven . 
and some really fast cars . 
it's a lot to digest . imagine how you'd feel . 
I feel like I'm entering a forbidden tomb ... 
take a whiff of heaven . 
I'd call you a sick , twisted fuck . but this is different . she wasn't your mother mother-- 
yeah , he's probably been serving cocktails , SO TO speak , at the orgies . 
sorry . Ginger got a little , you know , enthusiastic . 
it better not be my Aunt Trudy . 
with a refrigerated cargo bed full of sirloin tip . 
chicks are like buses . if you miss one , don't sweat it . there's another coming' round the corner . 
no , leave one . somebody's grandmother might want one . 
I love those springy head puppies ! 
brilliant ! Molly , give me all you've got . for Merk . 
we wanted to challenge the notions of classic beauty . we wanted to showcase women throughout the world . 
except the girl . the only one that really mattered . 
yes ... ? 
or was it , she wished he was dead - that's it - I believe he left the country with another woman - all rather sordid . 
oh no sir - just making some enquiries ... Just tell her that INSPECTOR Taylor called on you - she'll understand 
who said anything about surgery ... It'll only take a moment . 
yes - one please . 
yes , sorry - He's here to make sure that you are alright 
surgery ? are you a doctor ? 
don't worry about it - 
and not just any novelist - a great novelist - it was an impressive piece of work Ellen ... 
oh ... 
I'm good - I was just making a delivery near here , so I thought I would see if you were about ... 
I'd really like it if you would come round some time - Then I could cook you a meal - what do you say ... 
good - I've got to dash - Say that I said hello to Ellen for me would you ... 
what's this all about ? 
I'm here about the so called disappearance of your husband - It's best if we let old bones lie . know what I mean ? I'm working on the white angel case now - and I've got to check all known murderers or suspected murderers for the last five years ... And that means you ... So where were you last Thursday afternoon around five ... 
it did give me a chance to meet you again Ellen - It's all routine you understand ... So where were you ? 
as it happens , I was at home alone - maybe we could solve each others problems ? 
I'd watch her mate - she has thing for men - they disappear near her . 
I'm sorry , I couldn't - when is she due ? 
I don't know - it's your house Ellen 
I think he's fine - I don't know why you have this thing about men - it would be nice to have a guy in the house for a change - I don't think he would hurt a fly . 
I would prefer it if you kept away from Leslie 
you heard me - keep away from him 
yes I can ... 
leave ! ? who the hell do you think you are ? 
I had an accident - I fell down stairs ... 
no he had to - he's just - he's out ... 
I really don't know what to say 
sure ... 
the touch ? 
yes , two please . I'm sorry , I didn't mean to pry , it's just that I really loved your book 
what's with all the locks - and hammering 
my names isn't Angela ... 
don't worry - Is that my hammer Well Just make sure that it's put back in the garage ... 
I think I will pass ... 
yes , one and a half please . 
I'm a dentist 
oh , about six years since I graduated 
I don't know 
no - the police say I've killed fourteen - but I've not - I've killed many more . it amazes me how they just haven't found the bodies . what is society coming to when people just don't get missed . I agree , some of them are well hidden - I probably couldn't even show you where I put them - one girl , number eight I think the press called it - she wasn't even mine - I don't know who did it but I didn't 
oh anywhere - whenever I needed to - Do you know how easy it is to take them ? you just pick up a hiker , or someone off the streets - they believe so easily you know ,' Look , I have something to show you' I would say - and that would be it . one girl , I think her name is Debbie - she had broken down on the motorway , and I offered to take her to a service station to call for a tow truck - She just got in and I drove away . when I pulled into the layby and took out my knife - she just froze , and said - what do you want ? - I said , You know what I want . - But she didn't . getting rid of the bodies is just as easy - the first I cut up , put in bags with bricks in , and tossed them off Eldridge Bridge in broad daylight . the real problem with my work is the blood - there is so much of it - and it all spurts out so fast - like a fountain . it made such a mess of 
I don't know 
didn't DEBBIE deserve anymore ? 
what did you do with her ? 
the press think that the white angel is a woman - why is that ? do you dress up Leslie ? 
OK , the press call you the white angle because you only kill girls wearing white - why white - white clothes , blonde hair ... 
is' their' colour an expression of their inner self ? by that I mean , extroverts wear bright colours - so what are people who wear white ? 
is white an expression of innocence ? do you crave innocence Leslie ? 
do you feel sorry for the girls you have killed 
how long have you been watching me ? 
tell me about your wife ... 
then why did you marry her - 
what didn't you like about her ? 
I don't think so ... This isn't a game you know ... There aren't points or leagues . sure I killed my husband - but I am no killer . 
that's right ... Don't ever think that you and I are the same - we're not even remotely similar . I did what I had to do for myself , for my own self preservation - not to live out some bizarre role playing fantasy . my husband was sick - 
why not ? please - it would help me 
wonderful - like a great release - He was a malignant cancer and I had to remove him - the world is better without him 
tell me about your adopted MOTHER 
Stephanie ? 
did Stephanie kill your MOTHER ? 
what was your relationship with Stephanie ? 
I know this sounds insane Ellen , but ... telling you all of this , writing the book ... It feels good . don't get me wrong - I feel like a weight is being lifted from my shoulders ... When I tell you what I have done - I can't believe it is me ... yet I know it was . this is like a purging for me ... 
demons ... This wouldn't have been possible without you ... You have given me incentive Ellen - I can see clearer now ... 
nothing could be better ... 
I am ashamed of what I have done Ellen . when I read what you had written it made me think - look into myself - I haven't dared look into myself for a long time - I have stopped Ellen , I can't carry on - I won't carry on . all I want is to start a new life - I want a second chance ... You are good to me - you don't condescend , you're intelligent , and very beautiful ... 
open it ... 
but Ellen , I told you I have stopped ... 
out - I may be some time 
Leslie I'm sorry - I - I didn't know what to think 
I am sorry ... 
yes - I suppose so ... 
no thanks - 
he doesn't need to ... 
what was I supposed to do ? 
there isn't that much - you didn't even taste it - What's wrong - don't you like my tea ? 
why whats wrong with the sugar - 
crap ! - I wish I had taken a photo of your face when I gave some to that detective - What's wrong Ellen - you look pale - maybe you have been eating the wrong kind of foods lately - it could be food poisoning ? 
nothing Leslie - I just think we should wait ... 
it's what you would do to me 
no - I'll have you after 
chic magazine ? 
well , if you could come sometime just before we close , then I could show you everything and then we could go for a drink to discuss the finer points ... 
Brian ... 
yes it is ... 
then we would have to call in our locksmith to break the lock 
that's right ... 
I didn't say that - I'm sure it could be , but our clients must sign in first , checking signatures , and a photo ident - we had a nasty theft two years ago and we've been very strict since then . 
no -it's no problem - I do it all the time 
no - not all the time - I mean 
no - I've been abroad for a long time ... 
oh really - you must remember me from when I was a regular customer . 
I'm terribly sorry - I have a bad memory ... 
yes - I have had it for years . 
the one on the left - definitely ... 
I've got a tenant coming over later - can I take the afternoon off ? 
you know that circulation is down for three months in a row . 
then it's going to be' I killed for sex' ... Listen darling , why won't you let us use your real name for the features - if people knew that it was the Ellen Carter writing the features and not just some pseudonym - then we might shift more units . you haven't written anything in four years darling - I know you need this job - and if circulation keeps dropping , there's not going to be a magazine for you to write for ... 
I'm sorry - I didn't think 
well I'm glad I'm not them - what are you doing here so late ? come to that , what the hell have you got that for ? 
why don't you take a few weeks off - you're due some holiday time . 
don't mention it - now can I get back to my accounts , or do you want to fillet me ? 
papers ... ? 
I've decided not to open a practice here I want to set up a research clinic . for infant genetic disorder . 
no tax shelters . no funding . I want to fund the clinic - exclusively . the Diedre Mayfair Research Clinic . I'd like to find an existing building and move in immediately - while we draw up plans for new construction . 
I plan on liquidating almost evetything . 
Sut McKinley . marry me . 
you really love this guy ... ? 
hey - I love gloves- I look really great in gloves . 
is that a crack about our singing ... ? 
comes running out the front door - down the walk to them . Michael seems to pull inside himself . cool . aloof . 
I just - hate it when they're - finished . 
bullshit ! let me in ! Mikey - there are people who can help figure this ont . 
you can't just - 
the guy I told you about - Aaron ... ? he says I can learn to control them . that I could lose the gloves at some point . 
that's a wasp . fuckers'll sting a tree if they're bored- so - where is she ... ? 
if you like that type . 
left behind ... ? this about Rowan ... ? 
just don't fall off any ladders . 
my jury's still out on that , 
as far as touching things , yes . but the vision - that keeps pouring into my head- It won't go away God - if I could just understand it . 
nothing . absolutely nothing- 
the one time I want it to work ... 
you're not gonna give me the textbook analysia , are you doctor ... ? my vision was just the chemical reaction of an oxygen-starved brain - and nobody - 
Rowan ... 
like this ... ? like THIS ... ? ! 
I'll bet you say that to all the women who bring you back to life and then seduce you . 
what're you - a mindreader ... ? who was the man on the kitchen floor . ~ . ? 
you knelt there , helpless- You couldn't save him . there was so such anger in you- . death infuriates you ... 
it - it feels like - like I'm being filled up. crowded out of myself . like I'm fading away- 
and whose houses do you design ... ? 
you still feel that crazy ... ? 
really ... ? your family there ... ? 
too much ... too fast ... ? 
he fools around with his patients too . 
it's come to that , huh ... ? three weeks - and you need a psychic skin flick to perk up our sex life ... ? 
Y-U-H-E-E-Y-A-H . Yu-hee-yah ... ? no way , busters use it in a sentence . 
just sit there and soak up the vitamin D. 
Captain's orders . 
you don't know what you meant - because you don't know me . 
is this the part where you try and talk yourself out of how good this is ... ? 
let's see ... Next you tell me all the terrible things about you - and prove that we're doomed to fail - right ... ? you hate kittens and puppies , you've drivin all your lovers to suicide --and those mysterious deaths at the hospital were really - 
you stop it. you're loving , and gentel .. You're the most remarkable woman I've ever met --- so stop telling me I don't know what I feel just cause you're scared . cause it won't work . 
Michael - this place is increadible . you - you're brilliant ... The things you created ... 
God knows , I'm intriguing . 
 
Michael ! Jesus I've been trying - 
listen . last night - oh Christ , this' 1l take forever to explain . God , Michael ... 
Michael - I have to go - to New Orleans . I'll - I'll call yati when I - 
go to LAX and get on a flight to New Orleans . go to the Ponchartrain Hotel and wait for me . I'll call you there . 
goodbye , Michael . I love you . 
I know . it's not possible --- but I know . 
- a witch . 
Michael - I saw him ! twice ! Carlotta said I --- killed Graham - with - with my anger . 
is it more or less crazy than dying and coming back to life with hands that can see ... ? God , Michael --- what am I ... ? 
he's in there ! or are you out for a stroll in the garden ... ? ! where are you , goddamnit ... ? ! 
but it scares the hell out of you , doesn't it . Michael ... ? 
Rowan ... Think of what's in that book . think of last night ! 
I've come home , Michae1 , for the first time . I want to stay here - with you . 
I'm soon to be a very wealthy witch . 
they need doctors in New Orleans too . Michael - think what I could do with the money ! 
let's see . 
it's the next best thing to being there' - right ... ? 
hello .. 
he can't hurt us , Michael . it's us - our love . he can't find a crack in it . he can't find a way in . 
if we married , we'd shut him out forever . 
I don't think of us that way - ever . 
than letts get rnarried , Michael . I could put a spell on you - and make you say yes . 
no , I'm ve-ry good --- and you aught to know . 
hey - I'm getting married in the morning - I already gave up drinking. one Crutch at a time , Doctor . 
and I thought I was the mindreader .

hey - you're bleeding . 
you look a little green . 
Mm-hmm ... 
Mm-hmm ... 
did you see the old man on the --- 
it's not some fairytale in an old book . Michael - look at me . I didn't choose this , Michael . this is who I am . I love you . 
that's cause we're below sea level . 
that's not funny . 
talking to me dear ... ? 
- we made a fire . 
I'm serious . whatever it was - it's still there inside me , isn't it - change and all ... ? 
a little sore . Darm ... finish up my section , will ya ... ? 
lock the door . lock it 
I don't know .

hi . you - you wanna get some breakfast ... ? maybe see a movie ... ? 
gotcha . 
it's not true . you have to believe me . 
that's not good enough . why not ... ? ! 
I've never asked you to explain yourself - because you used to let me inside ! but I'm on the outside now ... you put me there ! 
why bother to ask , Ro ... ? why don't you just make me stay , .. ? 
how' bout a backward hex with a three-quarter twist ... ? 
Michael - I'm sorry ... Just give me -

always loved you .. 
I 1ove you , Rowan . I've always loved you . I only wanted to be in your thoughts . to bring myself into your thoughts - so I could be as we are now . 
explain this to me --- violated ... ? 
it is from love . 
if you knew how I yearn for that ... 
it you harm Michael , I will let my anger loose . and you will feel that . do you understand ... ? 
you're very clever , aren't you ... ? 
I bring her flowers too . 
go away ! I don't want you here . 
it's very dangerous to assume you know what a woman wants . 
what Michael gives me is stronger than anything you could ever inderstand . 
I LOVE him ! 
I LOVE Michael . Michael ! ! 
I only wanted to see as others do ... feel as others do ... ... but Marguerite could not help me . nor Julien ... 
no , my love . I want nothing more of the dead . I want you to --- Chang me . 
I love Michael ... 
you mustn't hurt him . mustn't - mustn't hurt .. 
only you ... 
what is wrong ... ? 
I do not understand ... 
there was no thought . there was no act . that is not what I am . 
that is what you must discover. see what I am , my love . with all your power - see me , and know what I am . 
tell me what I am , Rowan . 
it was an accident . Gifford , too . 
they want to come back . we have a pact - of mutual desire and consent . the Mayfairs ar. a beautiful tapestry . I have weaved you all together - from the start . I brought Petyr Van Abel to Suzanne . he had genius in him . scientific , precise . it was a perfect start . and on it has gone - father to mother ... sister to brother ... father to daughter ... 
Ju1ien was your father Your great-grandfather - your grandfather - and your father . all one in the same ... That is why he fought carlotta for your life . 
no ! don't ! Lasher ! ! ! 
anybody got a BP yet ... ? 
fast . 
he just went out like &amp; light- 
I'll tell OR we're bringing - 
wind - I love you with that which is endless within me . bring me your eyes - your touch - your voice ... 
the door , Michael. find the key ... 
Michael ... Do what you can . 
who is this ... ? 
I wish to speak to Ellie Mayfair . 
when did she die ... ? 
this is your aunt . Carlotta Mayfair . in New Orleans . 
Diedre Mayfair was your mother . 
yes . listen carefully , Rowan . have your attorney contact me at once . there are matters of immediate - 
I under5tand . all the same 
I had you sent away . 
it was quite warranted by the - situation . I realize this is a shock , but really , Rowan - you never even knew her . it's not as if you've suffered some great - 
a very tired one . I've been up all night - and I would .like to rest before the funeral . have your lawyer - 
out of the question Rowan , coming here will not change the - 
you came . I'm your Aunt Carlotta , my dear . 
in the coffin , my dear. where else ... ? 
a Mayfair it ever I saw one . 
I'm tired . I need to rest . 
other properties as well - here and in Europe . and vest holdings - in sugar , oil , gold , electronics . liquid funds over eighty million. tmpcssible to put a figure on it all . all yours now . 
and this - if you decide to take the rest . 
you can see well in the dark , Rowan . 
put your hatred for me aside , so you can clearly see what is ahead- 
she didn't feel them 
Antha ... your grandmother ... her life ended there , on the stones . head split open like a melon . 
you have the Mayfair eyes . tell me , Rowan --- what have those eyes seen that the mind can't fathom ... ? 
&apos; he' ... ? 
it Wes a dream ... ! 
stop it ! 
enough ! ! ! 
you're mad ! your mind is sick ! 
you - are - a - murderer . 
I'm NOT like you ! I'm NOT ! you're cruel - 
in certain cases , hell is the operative word . 
Gifford Mayfair - I'll cook your tongue on a spit ! witches ! 
I hope Ryan explained that if you stay in this town , you're shackled with pushy relations for the rest of your life . 
Gifford - that box glued to your hands ... ? 
nothing worse than a common tool . 
Mm-hmm . seems &amp; lot longer . 
I don't want it . 
then you wear it . 
it's over a month . the police say it happens all the time . 
Rowan's already called the hotel , Michael . at the cemetery by now , I would guess . 
Rowan's mother died at childbirth . and she doesn't have. any family . 
you sound certifiable . yon know that . 
a spirit . perhaps evil ... ... and he has come to you- with Diedre gone - you've ... inherited him . 
Rowan . 
don't tell Rowan about this . 
no ! she's pregnant , Aaron. she's got that to deal with - and the clinic .. she is not to hear about this. don't you think I know she spends half her Lite worrying about me ... listening to my heart , aren't you ... ? the Timex still ticking ... ? 
" go back , Michael . do what you can ... " 
nothing was ever more false . 
every day twice . 
what are you talk--- 
you have to warn her - this second ! I'm catching the next flight back ! 
a spacial entity . an organized energy. something that precedes our definition of existence . 
Michael - you loved that house as a child . you could work again ! you could make it ours . we'll sweep out the horror . and Lasher with it ! 
you've been shadowing the family for thirty years . it's only fitting you give one af us away . 
I have seen him again . last night . 
Lasher is my legacy - not Michael's . Aaron , I've seen the pain in Michael . I can't bear to see anymore . he's not to know . swear to me . 
I wish everyone would stop commenting on my health . I'm the doctor . 
two what ... ? 
but why would they do that ... ? 
but it doesn't make sense . they - they used Lasher ... they conspired with him . 
: no , I said , I hate what I'm doing to Darcy . oh , boy , men are stupider , it's true . 
: well , they are . 
: oh , I wish . a woman wouldn't have screwed over the woman she loved . no , they don't think that way . 
I think three ... 
what's their name ? 
she's awake . 
Norman Spencer . 
don't . 
it's Saturday . 
yep . 
three o'clock . 
genetic repair mechanisms in eukaryotic organisms . 
excellent . couple of Swedish sailor cells just gang divided a virginal cheerleader cell . 
if you have to work ... 
it's okay if you're not . 
it's just she's been the focus for a while . 
you know what I mean . 
you are ... 
you did a great job . she's a good kid . 
it's just us now . 
tired ? 
wanna fool around ? 
did you ... 
mmm . 
tomorrow . 
after that . 
did she say that ? 
honey , they're young . they're probably newlyweds . 
remember how we were ? 
why ? 
Claire , honey , we are not going to march next door and accuse our new neighbor of-- 
... when tonight they'll probably be keeping us awake . 
Claire ... 
nothing's going to happen . besides , I have to work tonight . the conference is in less than two weeks . I've got to stay focused on that for just a little longer . this is ... 
it's what I've been working for . 
look , I'll call Harvey Tomes in the psych department , see what I can find out . 
hurry ... 
is it gone ? 
I'm stuck here for another couple of hours . 
unless you need me to come home ... 
huh ? absolutely . take your time . 
there were some noises . I didn't want to disturb you . 
in the house . I was scared . 
no . can you drive me home ? I'll bring you back in the morning . 
it was there . this angry music all by itself . and I heard whispering . 
I don't know . just ... whispering . 
I do , I do . I'm sure I'm just ... how was your day ? 
really ? 
you are so brilliant . 
Madame Curie , Jonas Salk , Norman Spencer ... 
he's here giving some arcane spiel for the physics department , so Bob shine introduces us ... 
and he says ... you'll fucking love this , he says , " Doctor Spencer , I am a great admirer of your work ... " 
" ... especially Spencer's theorem ... " 
" ... of Perpetual distances . " everybody's checking their shoelaces . pins drop . " I'm afraid you've mistaken me , " I say ... 
" ... for my father . " 
didn't know he was dead , every stinking paper on the globe . 
did you tell her ? 
you didn't ? 
did you call about the Feurs ? 
huh . 
what's going on , Claire ? 
what ? 
and that means he murdered his wife ? this is getting ridic-- 
no . look ! in the window . 
a flare ? 
it's her ! I'm telling you . she whispered and turned on the music . she's trying to contact me ! 
she could be out . she could be sick in bed for all we know . 
I didn't do that . 
maybe . point is ... not me . 
Claire , listen to me . I know you're under some strain . but there's no such thing as ghosts . they don't exist . our neighbor did not kill his wife , and I ... wait , why aren't you dressed ? 
dinner . with Stan and his new girl . 
what do you mean ? Claire , we talked about it . you didn't want Japanese , I said , Our first date since ... 
... since Caitlin . you don't remember this ? 
yes , tonight . we're going to be-- 
... Don't get all ... 
okay , okay , I'm sure that I just ... 
restaurant . let them know we're running late . 
there we go . 
Norman ... 
I never said I wasn't upset . of course I'm upset . I miss her terribly . but I know what I saw and what I heard ... and it wasn't some " symptom " of something ... 
... and I don't think I'm some lonely , middle-aged woman cracking up . 
no ! and I don't need a psychiatrist ! 
he killed her . I'm not crazy . he killed her and-- 
yes . and he's going to get away with it . 
we had a seance . 
how did you-- 
maybe you resent how busy I've been . 
you know what I've got at stake with this paper . you know that . I can't help but think that you're doing this now to hurt me , or to sabotage me somehow . 
ever since the accident I've been worried that you'd been unhappy , or ... 
but then you've been so much better ... 
Sweetheart-- 
I will NOT . 
no , it's fine . I'm fine . 
call ya later . 
are you glad ? I'm glad . 
good . you sat in front ... I saw you there ... 
I felt you ... looking through me ... 
when she said it , there was something familiar ... but no . 
I ... 
you shoved me away and ran out to the patio . I took you home . 
it was maybe a week after the accident . we were moving . it was a hard time . 
sweetheart , it was over a year ago . 
not personally . 
it's her . this is the woman who I've seen . 
yes . the ghost . 
stop ... 
... Please stop ... 
stop IT ! 
wouldn't go that far . 
what's the matter ? 
since when ? 
why don't you shut up and fuck me , Professor . 
who ? 
stop IT ! 
what ? 
Claire-- 
oh God ... 
so you fucked a student ? ! 
don'T touch me . just get away from me . go ! 
what did you think I would do ? Jesus Christ ! I gave up my life and my music ... 
... Oh BULLSHIT . you had to topple perfect Daddy and that meant perfect wife , perfect family ... 
who ? 
leave her out of this ! 
stop ... 
I'm not going to listen to this . 
you should have tried harder . 
get out of my way . 
how did she know where it was ? 
we don't know that for sure . 
we have to get out of here . 
can't you see , she's trying to kill us . 
what ? 
how can you be sure ? 
Claire ... 
incredible . we should take a drive before they're gone . spend the night at some cozy little bed and breakfast . 
yep . there's some great places nearby . 
little village down seven . supposed to be charming . 
do you know it ? 
maybe we can stop there for lunch . 
nothing . 
you don't have to do that . 
fine . I'll do the shopping . 
okay . don't ... you don't understand what this is . 
I did NOT ! I did not kill anyone . Jesus . Claire , listen to me . I walked in and she was lying there dead . I swear to you . on my life ! she took pills and she killed herself in our house to destroy me ! to destroy us ! if I hadn't stopped by here before school , the painters would have-- 
it'S true . that's ... you have to believe me ! oh God , I'm telling you the truth ! I did what I had to , Claire . she was gone . there was nothing I could do for her . I did ... I put her in the lake . I rolled the car in ... and I watched it sink . and I've lived with that image ever since . I couldn't just stand there while everything-- my career , us , everything , just washed away . don't you see , Claire ? she's doing this ! this is exactly what she wants you to think ! 
shhhh . 
what ? 
good . I'm good . 
why does everyone find that so surprising ? 
okay , I'm a little tender . 
and so far my day has consisted of taking pictures of my roses for the garden club . 
what is it ? 
Jody-- 
you're discussing me with your psychic ? 
thanks , but I'm fine . 
oh my god . you bought it . 
it's niiice . 
absolutely . 
you got it . 
I don't know . when you say it , it sounds crazy . but what else could it all be ? 
what ? 
Jody , no ... 
... no ... no ... no ... 
please . that's all I need . 
what ? 
I don't ... 
no , you're not . but a presence in your house is not something to be taken lightly . 
are we hoping the ghost is going to have to pee ? 
the planchette ? 
I don't know . 
shhh . 
M-E ... 
it's initials . F is Feur . it's her . 
Jody , wait . 
I think so 
it's alright . 
what ? 
then what was it ? 
something was there . you saw it . 
yes . now I talked to Sela and there's a guy , this Pakistani guy down in Hartford ... 
and he's the real thing . Specializes in cases like this , like yours . 
but Claire-- 
okay . okay . 
I was down in adamant ... 
Artsy little village down seven . there's a guy there who sells my work . I had just dropped off some paintings and as I got in my car ... I saw Norman sitting at this little cafe . 
why ? 
relieved ? 
alone ? on a two lane road ? with a ton of Valium in your system ? 
all of us . 
no . 
what are you going to do ? 
if she was dangerous before-- 
you don't know that . if it's your belief that gives her form , then you've got to shut her out . somehow you have to break the connection . 
I know . 
we need help . please let me call the medium . 
Alight , alright . stay calm . you opened this door . there's got to be a way that you can close it . 
I have an idea . but , I mean , I'm just making this up ... 
did he say that ? 
I guess not . 
trust me , Claire . you hear something ... change the subject . you find something ... get rid of it , throw it in the lake . you know what happened . the rest is only details . and no one's ever glad they got a hold of those . if you want to put this back together ... just let it go . 
this is ... 
anyway , Claire slept with him ... 
... just so she could cut them off . 
we were suite mates . 
oh God ... 
stop . 
do we have to ? 
she's making this up . 
I met a dashing young grad student after a recital one night ... 
yeah . 
you know where she is ? 
Claire . 
it's fine . 
I'm not . we ... we met at a party . 
she never mentioned her father . 
I don't know . 
you must have been very proud . 
I should be going anyway . 
of course . 
biology . she wanted to be a doctor . 
it's Mrs ... It's Claire ... Spencer . from next door . is everything-- 
um ... yes . 
is everything alright ? 
I'm not ... 
who ? your husband ? 
what ? what are you afraid of ? 
tell me . please . 
tell me . I can help you . 
that's not ... It's not like that . 
I know . and I'm sorry . I've been consumed with ... my daughter left ... for school . 
I'm sorry . it's for the flowers . why don't you ... 
wait ! don't go ... 
you do ? 
and then you weren't there . 
would you like some iced tea ? 
of what ? what were you so afraid of ? 
what ? 
I couldn't catch my breath . that's not a metaphor , that's ... And I panicked . I never dreamed anyone would hear me back there ... I tried to leave him . went to my mother's in Boston . he brought my things up and pleaded with me to come home . 
no . no , I don't . 
yes ? 
I'm running late here . I just came back for my briefcase . 
this really isn't a good time . 
when ... when will she be back ? 
Oh-kay ... 
give me that shit . your wife . 
I am . 
just fine . it's a lovely party . 
almost . 
I know how hard it can be sometimes . 
well , I don't think I've seen you since the reception at Dean Ackerman's last year . 
no . I'm just not sure what you mean . 
at the party . 
Ohhh yes . no , no . just a little , you know ... We're fine . 
who's that ? 
mine . his . we both ... thought ... 
then why did you ? 
your husband ? 
do you really think so ? 
why is he worried ? 
fireball ? 
Mm-hmm . 
how do you know it's a she ? 
what does she look like ? 
do you have any idea who she is ? 
fine . 
try to communicate with her somehow . 
can't hurt . and I think it's important you find out what she wants . 
Nope . 
I don't know . my aunt used to use my uncle's old pajamas and a candle . 
well , that's what we're here for . 
yes , but ... 
isn't there something called group hysteria ? 
you're saying you willed these events to happen ? 
do you ? 
what do you think ? guess . 
have you been hurt ? 
you were in an accident ? 
that he doesn't ... see me , or , you know , that I'm ... that's something's wrong ... with me . 
no , it doesn't ... Okay , look , I see what you're doing here , and that's , I'm sorry , but that's not it . my marriage is fine . I've had some kind of " empty-nest " episode where I saw some things that weren't there . let's deal with that . I'm willing to deal with that . I just don't want to go conjuring problems where none exist . 
yes ? 
I know that . 
of course you will . 
Mom , I'm sorry . I wanted to tell you . but it never felt right . 
no , he wouldn't . 
that's not true . 
he loves you very much . he just-- 
it got so bad your father almost had to put me away . 
I started seeing things . 
did you ? 
what ? 
then we both are . 
oh ! the virgin has spoken ! Sarah Stop it ! 
you guys are being real assholes 
come on Mark mark Ah hell , why not . I'll get the maid to write the essays 
never fear , Tony is here . ladies first . 
one has to keep the distance between' them' and' us' 
servants . oh isn't it terrible darling , two more people have disappeared 
don't be facetious darling . now drink your milk , you're late for college 
when - you're a big boy . I mean you know it's bad for you 
I'll think about it . now run along darling . 
hi there Sarah 
so Mark , what's so urgent ? 
well divide 18 into three 
sell my soul ? 
I can't believe she went out with that monster last night 
safety in numbers man . 
must be what we came for . the four stand slowly and enter through the doors , which close behind them . they begin walking around the WAXWORKS , which appear gruesome . the first they spy is of a high school student with a letter jacket on the verge of being hacked with an axe by and angry woodsman . they give each other looks of disgust and continue on . the next is of a Frankenstein-esque creature carrying a woman in its arms . the four are now roaming around the WAXWORKS individually , with TONY encountering what appears to be a tribal INDIAN pointing a knife towards a victim . mark walks past a circus cart with some sort of werebeast inside , and then continues on to a staircase exhibit with a dead woman at the base of it . on the staircase is a zombie-fied creature . we see China walking on the other side of a bandage wrapped man pumping gasoline into a woman's mouth . finally , we see TONY walking up to a cottage room display . 
I've always wondered why someone would believe in something like that . 
what ? Tony and China , together ? 
I'm not kidding . I want to get out of here - now , ok . 
like her ? I don't know if I ever liked her . it's just you want what you can't get . 
come on . 
no , no James , it's not like that . Tony and China , they're just friends . 
OK , so maybe I was a little over emotional . 
oh that explains everything . 
big deal ! 
well . .this , is Mr. Lincoln . and that's the man I saw at the waxwork . 
China 
go away . 
uh , wrong picture Tony . 
uh yes , thank you . it was quite enjoyable . 
hello , Mrs. Webster . is China there ? 
no ? 
a party at a waxwork huh ? 
you don't happen to have the address do ya ? 
thank you Jenkins 
thank you 
thank you 
have a nice day sir 
Jenkins ! 
too late for that sir . give my love to the misses . get those bastards ! 
hi 
hmm . 
well that's for me to know - but I did enjoy rubbing oil all over that big . 
it's eleven forty-five let's go 
right . China I need a taking care of , not' hey how bout a pizza after class babe' . I'm looking for something just a little more in a man . a little' je nes se qua' . 
suffer ? we're living in America . 
oh Mark . it's ok . it's ok . 
I saw the greatest movie with mark last night 
he still likes you 
he did ? 
businessman ? 
doctor ? lawyer ? China lawyer , Doctor , I don't care . 
so why are you dating Jonathan ? 
but he still has something Mark hasn't . 
a body . I mean we're talking major body 
cause I have a way around all this , a way we can all make money and make this airline profitable again . what do you say we cut to the chase . I'm asking for a modest twenty percent across-the-board wage cut . 
I'll have a letter of agreement drawn up within two days . 
if you mean what you say , I think we're in the ball park . I'll take it to my people . 
you guys must know something nobody else knows . if those are my plans , it's the first I've heard of it . 
we'll take our chances . nice to see you again , Mr. Gekko . 
congratulations but rarer still is your interest in Anacott Steel . 
no . this time I'm in for the long term . this is not a liquidation , Gordon . I'm going to turn it around . you're getting a free ride on my tail , mate , and with the dollars you're costing me to buy back the stock , I could modernize the plant . I'm not the only one who pays here Gordon . we're talking about lives and jobs ; three and four generations of steel workers ... 
done . you'll hear from my lawyers . 8 a.m. Good night . 
you got it , G.G. 
he's flowing , Gordo . piece of cake . 
and , I'm pretty sure we got the Beezer Brothers out of Tulsa coming in with us and I'm working on the Silverberg boys in Canada . 
those days are over , Gordon . they were over a long time ago . 
sorry to hear that . I thought the kid had staying power . 
you told him about us ? 
because I don't want to see him hurt . 
I can't ... and I won't . 
maybe it does . don't patronize me Gordon . 
you're really twisted , Gordon . you're incapable of giving to anybody because deep down inside you there's a poverty that every last dollar in the world won't fill . 
Harold , you don't mind strolling around the block a couple hundred times , do you ? 
there came into Egypt a Pharoah who did not know . 
no , it's a prophecy . the rich have been doing it to the poor since the beginning of time . the only difference between the Pyramids and the Empire State Building is that the Egyptians didn't have unions . I know what this guy is about-- greed--he's in and out for the buck and he don't take prisoners . he don't give a damn about Northstar or us ... 
... that " scum " built this company up from one plane in thirty years , they made something out of nothing , and if that's a scum I'll take one over a rat any day ... 
Jesus , can't make a buck in this market , country's going to hell faster than when that sonofabitch Roosevelt was around ... too much cheap money sloshing around the world . the biggest mistake we ever made was letting Nixon get off the gold standard . Putney Drug--you boys might want to have a look at it . 
now that's a crap company , sure you'll make money on the takeover rumor , but what's being created . nothing . no substance behind it . 
you're right , Mr. Mannheim , but you gotta get to the big time first , then you can be a pillar and do good things . 
it's a winner Mr. Mannheim , trust me -- buy . 
... just kickin' ass and taking names , Mr. Mannheim . 
great Carolyn , doing any better would be a sin ... 
any better and I'd be guilty . 
... how do you know ? you wish ... 
... Janet get my father on the phone and the two other union reps , urgent ... 
oh Christ ! 
excuse me . 
oh yes , I remember you . 
Aha . poet or philosopher ? 
I'd give anything to have this in my house , even for a week . 
oh really ? well , I guess you can kiss that career as an art appraiser goodbye , because we paid over four hundred thousand for it at the Contemporary picture sale last June . 
sure you could , in Wildwood , New Jersey . if you sold this , you could have a pretty nice penthouse on Fifth . but you wouldn't have much left over for decoration . 
not really . I'd say that Gordon is one of the most astute collectors around . he has a great eye and he only buys the best . like this rug for instance , a silk Tabriz , the finest of its kind . the day after he bought it in London , a dealer representing the Saudi Royal Family offered him twice what he paid . it absolutely makes the room . see how this little bit of celadon in the border is picked up in the cushions oh the sofa ... although ... I don't know if I would have used that tea dipped linen for the upholstery - too dingy . and it's a sacrilege having that Pre-Columbian pot in the center of the coffee table . some dope might use it as an ashtray . 
you got it , a great spender of other people's money . 
where is it ? 
oh really . home of the exposed brick wall and the houseplant . 
what if I have a previous engagement ? 
I guess this must be destiny alright . my first yuppie apartment and ... my first yuppie . 
only if I want something bad enough . 
he's not a racehorse , Bud , he's a jumper . 
if I could have anything ... this would almost do . 
the conference , oh yeah . fine . we reached an agreement and decided to divide up the world between us . 
and what do you want ? 
well , why stop at that ? 
you're not trouble by any chance . are you ? 
... too perfect ... let's not even eat . let's just watch it and think about it . 
I'll bet he's got an opinion on the stock market too . this apartment is already ahead of its time . I call it the " demolished " look . they've already heard about it at House and Garden and they're coming next week to photograph it before it gets ... lived in . is that alright ? I'd love to have it in my portfolio . 
I'm kidding , I'm kidding , we're still young , Darien . so what's money anyway when everybody's making it , it's all relative . after all , this is not the house in Connecticut , this is just a crash pad good for a couple of years ... before we slip our two lovely kids , yuppie and Fruppie into the Lycee Francaise . 
that's right -- one with high yield , rich assets and no downside ... 
it's not me I'm worried about ... You know Darien , the only reason we haven't slept together is because we both know we will -- and not knowing when was the only surprise left . you owe me , I want you , what else is there ... but you , me , the world . ... right here ... make love to me ... now ... Stop me if I'm going too far . 
... are you going to trade all night again ? you got to go to work in a couple of hours . 
sure , why not , money's the sex of the 80's . I never had it like you when I was growing up , baby , it wasn't the upper east side . 
... that changes all my plans , I thought you were loaded ... 
I'm sorry . I was afraid something like this could happen . 
buddy , it's not your fault , and it's not your decision . 
don't cross Gordon . he'll crush you . you've worked hard to get where you are . if Gordon doesn't buy Bluestar someone else will ; and who's to say they won't do the same thing . 
are you mad ! why are you doing this ! we're so close , the town is going to be ours . don't throw away your future Bud ! 
I'm not looking to just survive . I've been doing that all my life . 
you're not exactly pure Bud , you went after Gekko with the same vengeance you went after me . look in the mirror before ... 
get the hell out ! 
why ? 
so you say . nice to meet you ; hope you're intelligent . like these , how'd you get these ? 
oh no , no ... 
I just want to let you know Mr. Gekko I read all about you at NYU Business , and I think you're an incredible genius and I've always dreamed of only one thing -- to do business with a man like you ... 
Jackson , Steinem ... 
... A cosmetics company by any chance ? what are you , the 12th man on the deal team ? the last to know ? 
so whatta you got for me , sport ? why are you here ? 
it's a dog , what else you got , sport , besides connections at the airport ? 
a comer . 80 medium-body jets . 300 pilots , flies northeast , Canada , some Florida and Caribbean routes ... great slots in major cities ... 
there was a crash last year . they just got a favorable ruling on a lawsuit . even the plaintiffs don't know . 
I know ... the decision'll clear the way for new planes and route contracts . there's only a small float out there , so you should grab it . good for a five point pop . 
Bud Fox , I look at a hundred ideas a day . I choose one . 
nice to see you again Mr. Gekko . 
... I can't even see it ... 
Bluestar was at 21 and an eighth when I left the office . it might spin up to 25 by the bell ... 
no sir , that would've been illegal ... 
... put the rest of it in a money market account for now . I want to see what you know before I invest it ... and save the cheap salesman talk , it's obvious . 
... come on sport , you gotta try harder , I need some exercise for chrissake ... 
... finish out the game , Bud , push yourself ... 
yeah ... not bad for a City College boy . bought my way into this club and now every one of these ivy league schmucks is sucking my kneecaps ... I just got on the Board of the Zoological Society , cost me a million ; that's the thing with WASPS -- they like animals but they can't stand people ! 
I guess your father's not a union representative on that company . 
the most valuable commodity I know of is information . wouldn't you agree on that ? 
&apos; course . Larry Wildman . one of the first Raiders . 
I remember that deal . you were involved ? 
I don't understand . 
follow him ? Mr. Gekko I ... It's not what I do . I could lose my license . if the SEC found out , I could go to jail . it's inside information , isn't it ? 
what about hard work ? 
don't expect to get it all , sport , you'll burn out . first rule of business is never get emotional about stock , clouds the judgment . where do we stand ? 
you're walking between the raindrops kid . I expect Sir Larry is choking on his royal chamber pot by now . 
... Can't it wait ? I'm good for it . ... Awright . come out , get the directions from Natalie and hurry up . 
allright . wait here ... 
stick around ... Larry , one of my " gang " -- Bud Fox . 
but we don't want to be greedy now , so let's let him have it at $ 72 . 
you're learning , sport ... 
Mr. Gekko , I'm there for you 110 % . 
... Gordon . 
how much ? 
yeah aren't you forgetting something Gordon : rule one , capital reserves . this company has $ 75 million cash in an overfunded pension . that buys us a lot of credibility ... ... and the beauty is you already own close to two percent of this sucker ... 
I'm talking to a stockbroker who wants to run an airline . it's gonna take me two years and 2000 headaches to turn Teldar Paper around , what do I need this dink airline for ? I'm up to my ass in more nuts than a fruitcake . 
what does that mean ? 
what makes you think you can ? 
alright ... Susan , get Buckingham on the box . I want him to look at it . and tell Jock Taylor at Thwick , Jensen ... So sport , the falcon has heard the falconer ... tell me more ... 
a pleasure to meet you , Mr. Fox . 
sure . what's worth doing is worth doing for money . it's a bad bargain where nobody gains . and if this deal goes through , we all gain . 
I'm sorry , this can't wait . 
I found out about the garage sale down at Bluestar . why ? 
you're walking around blind without a cane , sport . a fool and his money are lucky to get together in the first place . 
because it's wreckable . I took another look and I changed my mind . 
it's all about bucks , kid , the rest is conversation ... Bud , you're still going to be president . and when the time comes , you'll parachute out a rich man . with the money you're going to make , your father won't have to work another day in his life . 
buddy , it's not a question of enough . it's a zero sum game , sport . somebody wins and somebody loses . money itself isn't lost or made , it's simply transferred from one perception to another . like magic . that painting cost $ 60,000 10 years ago . I could sell it today for $ 600,000 . the illusion has become real . and the more real it becomes , the more desperately they want it . Capitalism at its finest . 
the richest one percent of this country owns half the country's wealth : 5 trillion dollars . one third of that comes from hard work , two thirds of it comes from inheritance , interest on interest accumulation to widows and idiot sons and what I do -- stock and real estate speculation . it's bullshit . ninety percent of the American people have little or no net worth . I create nothing ; I own . we make the rules , Buddy , the news , war , peace , famine , upheaval ; the cost of a paper clip . we pull the rabbit out of the hat while everybody else sits around their whole life wondering how we did it ... ... you're not naive enough to think we're living in a democracy are you , Buddy ? it's the free market . you're one of us now ... take advantage of it . you got the killer instinct , kid , stick with me . I got things to teach you ... 
believe me , Buddy , I was gonna discuss this with you at the right time . look , why don't you calm down and come to the apartment for dinner tonight . bring Darien ... 
are you with me Buddy ? 
dump it . 
Gordon . 
well we're thinking of putting up a statue of you in the subway . I hear you're moving up in the world . an associate already . not bad . how's Margie ? 
nah , she asked the wrong question . 
" what are you thinking ? " ... that was it . the hours are hell , but the money's starting to tumble in . I know this guy who's got an iron- clad way to make money , I can't lose and I can't get hurt . 
yeah , check out Teldar Paper , it's still not over . 
what about you , I hear you guys are handling the Fairchild foods merger and it may not be going through . any surprises I haven't read about in the Wall Street Journal ? 
who's listening ? it's just one college buddy talking to another . 
relax , Roger , everybody's doing it but you don't know , you don't know . 
more money than you ever dreamed , Roger . and the thing is no one gets hurt ... how bout a beer ? 
... and you don't have to put up a dime , Roger . 
... got a strange call from the SEC . they asked to see my records ... Bud , this is a heavy ... 
alright ... I just wanna slow down Bud ... no more calls for awhile , no lunches ... we suspend our business , alright ... 
he never told me ... 
Lisa . Gordon ? oh , Mr. Gekko . sure . would you , uh , like to come in ? 
I got this guy who should know tells me buy Hewlitt Packard but I been burned on tips . what do you think Bud ? 
it's ready to take off . I'd jump all over it if I were you . 
no , no Dixon , my client wants to buy a large , large block of stock and needs to spread it around . I'll park some money in your account and if it hits , you get a big cut . I'm telling you , this is the easiest money you ever made ... 
what'd you tell him ? 
look Dixon , calm down ! it's not illegal to buy stock or to be right . and it's not all that unusual to be spot checked on a big buy . tell him you did your homework and you thought the stock was a sound investment . 
tell' em your father gave it to you . 
they won't . that's not their jurisdiction . 
yes ! read the Constitution , it's all in there . and remember--you don't know anything , nothing . 
good . then call him back . and call me back . don't worry . 
what are you doing here ? 
first of all , Mr. Fox , you can't just come barging in here . and what makes you think it's his birthday ? 
stay here , I'll see what I can do . 
... have a nice day Mr. Stone . ... Mr. Gekko , the conference call is ready . Mr. Sugarman and Mr. Lorenzo in Delaware . Mr. Bernard in Los Angeles . Mr. Jackson and Ms. Rosco in London . they're all on . 
ah , I had a tough day . some jerk D.K'd me and I gotta cover his loss . 
D.K. -- didn't know -- who I was when the options he bought took a bath . he reneged on me . 
coulda been a contender . 
look Dad , I'm not a salesman . how many times I gotta tell you I'm an account executive , and pretty soon I'm going to the investment banking side of the firm . 
Dad , it takes time . you gotta build a customer list . I'm doing it . I could make more money in one year as a broker than five years at the airline . 
50 K don't get you to first base in the Big Apple , Dad , not any more . I pay 40 % in taxes , I got a rent of 15,000 , I got school loans , car loans , food , park my car costs me 3 bills a month , I need good suits , that's $ 500 a pop , shoes ... 
it's Queens , Dad and a 5 % mortgage and you rent the top room--I gotta live in Manhattan to be a player , Dad . there's no nobility in poverty anymore , y'know . one day you're going to be proud of me , you'll see ... 
can you spare three hundred ? pay you back next month , promise . 
not in here Dad ... please . later . 
how's Mom ? 
... work okay ? 
that's great Dad . 
hey to Bluestar , as your broker all I can advise is hold on to that stock Dad ...

... Dad , you should've been a CEO . how about dinner ? 
wait ... next week's booked . let me check with my girl and get back to you on Monday . 
... gotta run Dad . you stop smoking , you hear ? 
no , what I see is a jealous old machinist who can't stand that his son's become more successful than himself . 
that's because you never had the guts to go out into the world and stake your claim . 
I'll be damned that when my men come to me tomorrow morning , wanting to know what's going on , I'm going to lie to them ! 
you speak for me , son . 
no , thanks , I'm nervous enough . 
yeah , don't want to be late for my own funeral . 
maybe that's the price , Bud , maybe so . it's gonna be rough on you but maybe in some screwed up way , that's the best thing that can happen to you ... stop trading for the quick buck and go produce something with your life , create , don't live off the buying and selling of others ... 
yeah , where's your machine gun . 
looks bearish to me , buddy . you got it all upside down . okay , I'm giving this to you and you alone ,' cause I feel sorry for you . take the Knicks against the Bullets , and my pick of the day -- Duke to beat the spread against Wake Forest . 
Howard the jerk reneged on me . I've got to cover his loss to the tune of about seven grand ! I'm tapped out man , American Express got a hit man looking for me . 
thanks Marv , I'll make it good to you . you know what my dream is ? one day to be on the other end of that phone ... 
it concerns his future !

what did they find out about the Gulf War ? one shot : one bomb , falling though the roof , building coulda been made of &lt; u &gt; Legos &lt; / u &gt; .

Brazen it through ? Brazen it &lt; u &gt; through &lt; / u &gt; ? they're going to hang us out to dry like the &lt; u &gt; laundry &lt; / u &gt; --- do you know what we've &lt; u &gt; ddd &lt; / u &gt; ...

yep . well , we started it , he ended it ...

Gloria -- sell the House .

... what have you &lt; u &gt; done &lt; / u &gt; to me ... 
... what are we going to do ... ? 
no . no . he didn't mean anything by it at &lt; u &gt; all &lt; / u &gt; ... 
... and he spent the last twelve years in a Milit &amp; Ry Prison ... 
what about him ? 
could we have you in here , please ... 7 
you wouldn't be here if it wasn't true . it's true , right ? 
we've just found out They Have the Bomb . we've Just found Out They Have The &lt; u &gt; Bomb &lt; / u &gt; , aaaand ... No , No wait a second , no , no , wait a second , No . the Bomb's not ... it's not &lt; u &gt; there &lt; / u &gt; -- because they'd have to have a rocket and that shit n'they're a buncha wogs-- it's ... it's a &lt; u &gt; suitcase &lt; / u &gt; Bomb . Ooookay . it's a &lt; u &gt; suitcase &lt; / u &gt; bomb , and it's .... in Canada ! eh ? Albanian terrorists have placed a suitcase Bomb in Canada , in an attempt to infiltrate the bomb into the USA . 
no , this is great . 
okay . okay . the &lt; u &gt; suitcase &lt; / u &gt; Bomb ... 
... but the President wonders about the possible Albanian Backlash ... 
... and he's got a &lt; u &gt; negative &lt; / u &gt; rating of ... 
I don't think you're gonna need it . 
they got the guys on a &lt; u &gt; retainer &lt; / u &gt; , it's cheaper , &lt; u &gt; pay &lt; / u &gt;' em , but don't lettem touch it ... Let'em leave us alone . 
what can it hurt is they offend me . 
a small , " calico " kitten , sir . " calico . " 
can we have a white one , please ... 
listen to what I've ... listen to ... does anybody know Morse Code ? 
what'd ya think ? 
all we have to do now is sell it to the President . 
hi , How are ya ? &lt; u &gt; Listen &lt; / u &gt; to this , willya ... 
it's the gratitude of your &lt; u &gt; party &lt; / u &gt; , and of your &lt; u &gt; President &lt; / u &gt; ... 
indeed it is . 
... like the &lt; u &gt; sound &lt; / u &gt; of it , eh ... 
Wilfred , that's not bad . 
... twelve years . 
and ? no . I don't wanna know . what do you &lt; u &gt; mean &lt; / u &gt; " and ... " ? 
what happens if he doesn't have his medication ? 
well , get on the phone , and &lt; u &gt; get &lt; / u &gt; it ... 
oh , Lord .... 
come on . 
come on . 
shot down , forced down ... You guys are &lt; u &gt; missing &lt; / u &gt; it ... You're missing the &lt; u &gt; opportunity &lt; / u &gt; 
no , no , no ... 
... how do we explain that ? with the World Watching . 
but how do we explain the fact he was in prison ? 
what rig ? 
what are you talking about ? 
and &lt; u &gt; what &lt; / u &gt; is bigger than a triumphal Homecoming ... ? 
naw , we can't play this one catch-up . that's how long since you stopped beating the wife . we have to ... 
you're with him tonight , watching the President's Speech , when the President ... 
&lt; u &gt; lure &lt; / u &gt; him . 
well , darlin' &lt; u &gt; I &lt; / u &gt; ain't your confessor . tell him you've got some info on the President's sex scandal , it's on your conscience , believe me , he'll drop what he's doing . okay ; &lt; u &gt; Now &lt; / u &gt; : folks , folks , folks , this is a shitty business , and it needs no Ghost Come From the Grave to tell us that . but in Six Days , Lord willing n'Jesus Tarries , I am going to take you beauties into the second term . ..... wait til you hear the speech tonight . the 3-0-3 Speech ... where's the Fad King , by the way ... 
when you ... What ? I'm busy . 
&lt; u &gt; Hello &lt; / u &gt; . what ? 
for Schumann . 
as long as you keep overpaying me , I'll be the first to go into production on three , and four , as well . 
Mr. Wallace , I could have 10 of them ready by tomorrow . 
at this stage , you either get form or function . you said she wanted function . I gave you function . what are you complaining about ? 
performing solo . enjoying the concert so far ? 
I must make them very nervous if they let you out of prison . you know , we have so much in common — — we have such history together — — I've been thinking we should become friends . 
who else do you know who touches the world with synthetic hands ? 
now , is that any way to talk to an old buddy ? I mean , just because I'm carrying around the joy of killing your family inside me doesn't mean we can't be friends . 
I'm sorry , the party you're trying to reach is not answering . is there anyone else you would like to talk to ? 
you really are pathetic , you know that ? Mathew Grimes is only one letter in my alphabet . he is nothing compared to me . 
why's that ? 
let me put it to you this way ... whether I'm here ... or whether I'm not ... I'm leaving an indelible mark on the world tomorrow night . 
where did you plant the C-4 ? ! 
my ... secret . 
I thought you liked me being in the audience . don't you want me to see it ? 
you are going after Mayor Bennett . 
aren't you going to watch with me ? 
I really did think I was still in reality . at least , until now . beam me up , Scotty ! 
Barnes , YOU'RE DEAD ! 
no , I just like the effect a tape recorder has on you . how you feeling today ? 
in other words , par for the course . how do you feel about the simulation you participated in yesterday ? 
I know . I was there . I saw the whole thing . if I was your therapist , I would have advised you against putting yourself back into that kind of situation . 
if I had died yesterday , you'd have already dissected my brain and analyzed it to see if I carry any genetic predisposition toward violence . 
not much . he was just a computer program . nothing more . 
go to hell . 
enough ! 
what you need is a collar . 
every time I said it , it was . I never really thought I was going to make it . 
fine . never felt better in my life . see , I'm a good liar . 
don't worry . if I can't handle it , I'll just kill everybody . 
Manson didn't kill the first cops to arrive on the scene . 
Charlie ? you say that like you're close , personal friends . 
I know who would know . 
he had a twin brother who was a musical child prodigy who died in an electrical accident at age eight . Lindenmeyer went into an emotional shell until was 17 . all he did day and night was play the violin . 
do me one favor — — if you shoot at anything , make sure I'm nowhere near it . 
checking my pulse . it's elevated . you enjoy frightening me , don't you ? 
this Lindenmeyer's a real piece of work . 
the government must have figured there was no better person to create a psycho than a psycho . 
I am the demon from the bottomless pit ... 
I am impressed . 
who said that ? 
he's part of the mix . Sid 6.7 is a composite . 
creating a whole far more dangerous than the sum of its parts . 
as a matter of fact , it is . 
Dahmer carried the head of one of his victims in a bowling bag for over a week . kept it in his locker while he was at work in a candy factory . we need to get a look at Sid 6.7's final profile . 
in order to find him , we have to understand what makes him tick ... 
give me a goddam break . I'm not going to go anywhere alone . 
I prefer keeping my professional life separate from my personal life . 
thank-you . her name is Karin . 
I told you , it was on the way and I wanted to change clothes . 
Sid 6.7 is no longer bound by his programming . 
now that he's in the real world , there are no longer limitations on his behavior like there were in virtual reality . Sid is going to evolve . 
what I do know is that whatever he's becoming , Sid 6.7 is going to be even worse than he was before . 
you know , considering you've only been out of prison for seven hours , you're re — adapting quite well . wait , I didn't mean that the way it sounded . I meant ... 
dammit , I hate sounding so clinical all the time . all I meant to say was I thought you were doing well , but then I ... 
I ruin so many moments by analyzing them when I should just be living them . 
stop me . 
this is my area of expertise . 
you know I am . 
tell him . 
I'm doing the best I can ! 
start of what ? 
you like baseball ? 
you could have just flashed him your badge , you know ? 
both . 
if you're gonna do it , better do it now . 
no ! Grimes isn't back . he's only one part of Sid . Sid 6.7 is a hell of a lot worse than Grimes ever was . get a hold of yourself ! 
they're going to fry me for it , anyway . 
Sid 6.7 told me after he killed the two guards . he suggested I kill you rather than him . 
I pose an unacceptable danger to the public , remember ? 
Sid 6.7 isn't Grimes . 
think he's keeping track of his creation ? 
see something ? 
nice work . 
you mean there's something you haven't asked me ? 
you don't know ? 
because this pain — in — the — ass criminal psychology expert has helped me understand what I'm capable of . and what I'm not . and better than anyone else , I am capable of stopping Sid 6.7 . 
... I think so ... You ? 
Lindenmeyer ? 
Sid ? 
I couldn't tell you . 
duck ! 
you won't want to watch . turn around . 
did you recognize the son-of-a bitch who got away ? 
think hard -- it'll come to you ... 
it was you , wasn't it ? 
you amped the neural connectors back up , didn't you ? you're the reason the convict died . you're the reason I got fired ! 
my God ... 
what do you expect me to do , put your character module in my pocket and just walk you out of here ? 
I think I understand what you have in mind ... 
what do you expect me to do , thank him ? 
of course you are . 
glad to ... 
I'm begging you ... please don't kill me ! please ! 
what's wrong with Parker ? 
show me his physical sensory level . 
turn it down ! 
talk so I can understand . 
then fix it . 
show's over unless I get to see what you've been working on after hours . 
do I get to see it or not ? 
you're ... such a wimp . 
it's nano — technology , isn't it ? machines the size of molecules ... 
it feels so .. .real. 
this is supposed to be years away . 
how do you kill it ? 
I know . I'm ready to incubate something a little more advanced than a coldblooded reptile . if you want to experience the future , meet me in my office in 15 minutes . and bring the Sheila 3.2 character module with you ... 
what I need is a nymphomaniac . 
the reason you insisted on testing my system with prisoners is because of the increased risks involved with increased realism . 
you've had a year — and — a — half to make all the Adjustments you want , Lindenmeyer . ) Elizabeth Deane does not give second chances . neither do I. You're fired . 
you are to turn over the Sid 6.7 program , and all its documentation , for immediate destruction . is that understood ? 
he hears ... everything . 
Barnes used to work for him when he was still a cop in the field , remember ? 
Lindenmeyer developed neural connectors that tap directly into the nervous system . if the simulator isn't calibrated properly , experiencing death in this level of VR is like experiencing death within a dream . the experience becomes real . 
I was assured the problem was corrected . 
neither will the public . the media has caught wind of his pardon . unless Mr. Barnes starts giving me some tangible results , I'm going to put him back in his cage . 
only because I got pulled out early . 
this is a full pardon . it authorizes your immediate release . 
how do you know I won't run ? 
trying to find out where the bomb is . where the hell have you been ? 
call off the manhunt looking for me . I didn't kill the transport guards . 
no , but I've confirmed the reelection rally is the target . how much C-4 is missing ? 
if I were you , I'd get every demolition team in the city searching in and around the Biltmore Hotel . 
Sid is smart enough to know you'd check everywhere in the immediate area . whatever the device is , he's probably got it timed to move into position just before it detonates . have the demo teams check every subway tunnel , water pipe , gas pipe , and sewer pipe that goes under , over , or into the arena . 
you're the highest law enforcement official in the country . use the fucking army if you need to . 
or what , you'll authorize my death a second time today ? 
we have an emergency situation which requires somebody with expertise in criminal psychology . under the authority vested in me by the President , I'm giving you temporary re — assignment . 
not if you're with him every step of the way . 
I understand the risks involved here . but there is nobody better qualified to go after Sid 6.7 than Barnes . and , there is nobody who knows him better than you . if a situation becomes volatile , you will find a way to quell it . I have complete confidence in you . 
any sign of Lindenmeyer ? 
until we know what new influences are affecting him , we can't be sure . 
don't blame yourself . in your shoes , I don't think I would have told Parker , either . so do you think Grimes has become the dominant personality ? 
you think he's smart ? 
I need your help-- 
I don't set policy . you have the key ? 
got it . 
why'd .. .you pull me out ? 
real , my ass . it's an overblown game . anybody ever catch that fucking psycho ? 
I'm getting by . 
don't give up , Parker . not ever . 
what about them ? 
it's too early in the morning for me to be cordial . you got any coffee ? 
I've seen worse . 
if you can catch him . 
what she's going to do is get in my way . 
fine — — you want to stay here ? 
their weapons missing ? 
where's my gun ? 
you son — of — a — bitch . how could you let them put the implant in my head ? how ? 
then I guess we're even . 
if you're lying , I'll hunt you down and kill you myself . 
why wasn't I told ? 
whatever . 
catch him and your record's clean . 
if you try to run , I'll hunt you down and kill you myself . 
there's already a task force out looking for Lindenmeyer . every other officer in the city will be hunting Sid right along with you . 
why would they be going there ? 
Barnes wouldn't kill two innocent guards . 
do I need to remind you what happened to his wife ? to his daughter ? I will stake my reputation that Barnes didn't kill those guards . 
) There is one program with approximately 1.3 million lines of programming . it is thoroughly secured , which is not surprising considering Lindenmeyer created it . 
look , I feel bad about this , so I'm going to try to look into the programming of his Maestro teaching tool for you . ) I've had one sitting around for years . maybe I can learn something that you'll find useful . 
me ? what did I do ? 
I've discovered something about Lindenmeyer' 5 Maestro teaching tool I thought you should know ... The harm done to the music students who used the device — — it was not by accident . the machine was designed explicitly for that purpose . Lindenmeyer intended to hurt the kids using it . 
hello . 
today , a good girl . 
from the terrace . 
no , I don't want to . 
I have a headache . 
what happened to me ? 
have I slept long ? 
right , let's go . and keep the compliments to yourself . I don't like them . 
I'm only good at making people laugh . 
she looks like a sick marrow ! 
when you are , miss . 
I'll talk the way I want to . I've had enough of this . 
I've had a gutful of this . 
I've just had a letter from your uncle . he won't be able to come when you take your vows . 
in any case he's asking you to come and stay with him . 
I'm afraid that his health is not good . he's your only relative and you ought to say farewell to him before taking your vows . you will certainly never see him again . 
I have no desire to see the world again , but if you order me to ... 
mother . 
I had so many things to think about ! 
I have nothing to reproach myself for . all I know is that I've changed . with all my strength , which is not much , I will follow the road that the Lord has shown me . one can also serve outside a convent . 
you are forgiven . goodbye . 
they shut all right now . and the blankets are ready . 
this louse is looking for trouble . 
I can't do anything to make you stay ? these people annoy you , isn't that it ? 
I'm afraid . 
a black bull came . 
it's a very big one . 
he couldn't get through the door , then ? 
you little liar ! get out of here ! 
don Jaime loved to watch me skip . 
is anything the matter , Mr. Mayor ? 
there's been an accident . 
come with me . 
they told me it isn't at the hospital . 
I'll take him to the doctor tomorrow . come on now , sit down and go on eating . and you , look after him as if he were a sick brother . be understanding . now finish eating and then go to bed . everyone in bed by eight o'clock ! 
things seem to be getting better . 
parents ? nobody cares a damn , what's the use of them ! 
right , I won't say that , but I still think they're no use . 
stop this ! 
then let him go and he'll follow you . 
how much do you want for him ? 
Canelo ! 
are you Jorge ? 
I've been expecting you ; I got a letter from the lawyer . 
well ... is it so urgent ? 
but you have a right to let us know what you think . 
and do you know that my mother and I had to suffer ? if my father had bothered himself a little more about us , I'd be an architect now . 
I'm not like you , you have your wife . 
leave him alone . 
do they worry you that much , then ? 
is that all you're going to devote your life to ? 
don't worry . nobody's going to disturb you . 
I'll be ready . 
you can come and live again in the big house if you want . now that I'm alone , I can settle down anywhere . 
she's left . 
no . 
he was very good . better than some people would think . 
I don't know , sir . 
why ? 
these chairs are in good condition . with a little varnish and some new covers this one will be quite presentable . 
that's stupid ! plaster ! it can still be used . 
me , rich ? come on ! 
where's the dough ? 
not in that way ; you're always looking for company . 
nothing . 
it's Viridiana . she's getting on my nerves . 
no , not mad at all : she's rotten with religion . 
run and get something to mop it up with , quickly . 
what are you going to do ? 
you're happy , aren't you ! 
I'm bored . I'm alone all day and I don't know what to do . 
she isn't my cousin . 
I think I'd better go tomorrow . 
you see how much you like her ? 
come on , miss . just so the Virgin can be really pretty . 
do you have great devotion for the Virgin ? 
that doesn't matter ; I like it . 
he was asking for it . 
quiet , my dove . quiet , or I'll ... 
fifteen yards . 
that's it . 
the fields have been left so long ; with a good manuring anything will grow . 
and in the vegetable plot ? 
no , sir , it's nearly six o'clock . okay , let's get a move on ! when are you leaving ? 
what will the lady say ? 
if everybody agrees , but to make a roast takes four hours . 
yes . 
I didn't want to do it , Don Jorge . they made me ... 
yes , sir . good night . 
I have asked her but she's ungrateful . sometimes I feel like hitting her . when I talk to her about the convent , she turns to stone . 
what's the matter ? 
yes , yes , but there's no need to bring that up . how far are you prepared to help me ? 
why don't you speak to her , Ramona ? women are good at that sort of thing . think of something that will make her stay a few more days . you are kind , Ramona ! speak to her . I know I don't need to offer you anything , but , if you're successful in this , I'll not forget you or your little girl . 
the way she looked at me , Ramona ! she hates me now . I think I've made a great mistake . she's going away , she's going away and nothing will stop her . 
what for ? she'll only look at me that way again ... I couldn't . you go . perhaps she'll listen to you . try to convince her . 
tell her I lied , that I didn't take advantage of her . 
yes , sir . 
it's only that ... It's all very odd , sir . 
I'm well ... The bus was late , wasn't it ? ... What was the journey like ? 
you'll think you're still at the convent . 
a very short while , Uncle . I've been given permission to stay only a few days . 
no . mother Superior told me to come . 
to tell you the truth , not very much . I cannot lie . I respect you and I am grateful to you because I owe you everything materially , but otherwise ... 
no . 
in twenty years the grass has invaded everything . there are spiders all over the house except on the first floor . I hardly ever go out . 
my maid Ramona's daughter . she's a little animal . 
how like your aunt you are , even in your walk . 
you see , even the voice . 
you are spoiling me too much . I won't know what to do with myself when you've gone . 
what do you mean ? 
oh , some years ago I heard my mother talking about it . but is it true ? 
don't you ever see him ? 
how could anybody behave like that ? 
evil . 
and this innocent child . 
this evening we must do something special by way of a farewell . 
I should like you to do something for me . it's an innocent sort of thing but I'm very set on it . 
I don't like masquerading , but as you see I decided to give in to your whim . 
no , Uncle , and now I'm pleased to have been able to do this favor , because , although I didn't think so at first , you are really a good man . 
wasn't that cowardice ? 
it's up to you entirely . don't leave , then ... 
it's my fault . if I'd come to see you more often , if I'd invited you here for holidays , maybe everything would be different . 
you must be out of your mind . I've been so happy these last few days -- now you've spoiled it all . 
don't go ! 
no , it's true . last night when you were sleeping , I had you all to myself . 
go away ! leave me alone . 
you must listen to me before you go . 
all that I said just now was a lie . I said it so you wouldn't leave . I only molested you in my thoughts ... I can't bear to have you leave me , hating me like this . tell me you believe what I'm saying and I'll let you go . 
then you won't forgive me ? 
are there many windows ? 
then it's a respectable house . 
so you didn't come from the poorhouse ! 
smoking makes me feel ill ? it's these filthy fag ends . I won't mention in this company what's upsetting you . 
tell me the answer to this ! what bird lays eggs in a barn ? 
Enedina and Paco ... 
they're playing games behind the couch ... 
that one . 
really , Don AMALIO , there's not much point in making a fuss . 
no , the children sleep with me . 
no , I don't want to because they yell . and I've got news for you too . 
didn't you say you know how to make vanilla pudding ? 
let me go , Don Amalio , I'll tear her apart . 
it's a present from my parents . 
drum banging real times . 
it was an accident ! 
fish , I'm really sorry . I just ... I owe you man . desert . 
that's right . 
I KILLED MY BROTHER ! 
I don't think that's a good idea . 
are you guys gonna fill this place with kids ? you sure got room for them . 
take your time . I wish I had . 
so where to on the honeymoon ? 
that's our plan . 
... We will compare these before photos with whatever form of degeneration presented to us in 24 hours , no matter how low , how vile ... 
... regression of Modern Man to his most primitive , ape-like state ... 
the post-Vegas Man . 
okay boys , smile ! 
I kind of like " till death do us part . " I mean , this is forever . in sickness and in health , through good times and bad . honey , what do you think ? 
okay great . what will that be ? 
" you Send Me . " 
you know , Darling you ... you send me ... Darling you ... You mend me . honey , sing it for Judge Tower . 
I do . 
Yup . 
how do you know she's dead . 
I got to agree with that . 
what ? 
did she believe you ? 
you can tell when people believe you . it's obvious . 
a move ? 
Greenpeace ? 
he came to me early today , was talking about money , insurance money . said he was gonna get what was his . 
he said he was the Brain Trust . said he was smarter than all of us . he started reading " Atlas Shrugged , " staring at himself in the mirror . 
all week long . 
yeah . I'm thinking about Micheal's Franco Harris fixation . you know how Micheal was always harping " Immaculate reception ? " I've seen that play . a lot of times ... and I have to say this ... Franco was lucky . flat out , right place , right time . that's it . he was where the ball bounced . you get me ? 
I'm saying it's luck . all luck . you work your entire life , all the training , focus , all the dedication , all irrelevant . where does the ball bounce ? my father spent his whole life trying to start a company , practiced every day , worked like a dog , finally got enough money . he's paid the dues , he's ready , does all the market research , picks his shot - " Pup corn . " 
where ? 
that's a good one . 
that's what I'm thinking . 
Yup . 
I don't know . she's really been stressing out . 
what does that mean ? 
about what ? 
I just want her to be happy . 
I'm not breathing right . 
lately I'll just start getting lightheaded , dizzy , and I realize I haven't breathed in like two minutes . 
he's your brother . 
go for it . 
I'm sorry ... I'm sorry ... I'm sorry ... 
just go ahead and say what's on your mind . 
at the newsstand on 3rd . 
buzzing ? 
I don't hear it . 
have another drink . 
the wahoo ? 
the wahoo moment ? 
I think so . 
no . no . no . this is my doing . you see I'm gonna have my wahoo spark for my own . for Lois and the kids , for my brother , for Franco . I'm gonna turn myself in . I am all that . I'm gonna do it for sweet Lois . 
what is it ? 
you did all right dad . 
I'm just so scared of that song . that fucking , " My son just arrived the other day ... he says thanks for the ball , come on let's play . I got lots of bills come again next day . he's grown up just like me ... My boy is just like me . " Gordon fucking Lightfoot , Cat Stevens , whoever , that song just fucking kills me . 
just kills me ... 
I love you so much it hurts . me and your mother marvel at what you have become . you're going to have a wonderful journey with this girl . I feel it deep inside . a wonderful , magical journey . and I'm , like I said , just so proud of how you turned out . you go out and knock' em dead Keith . knock'em dead ! 
yeah , Dad . it's great . 
OK , OK . you guys just go back in . Dad , keep going with the toast , we'll be right in . go on . 
government cutbacks . 
we missed the deadline . 
I don't think so . 
I'm not sure . 
I think so . 
I sent a lot of checks , I'm not sure what all of them are . 
sent it . 
sent it . 
Yup . 
yes . 
I think I forgot the tent . 
I think so . 
why what ? 
I didn't mean to Liz . I'm sorry . 
I'm not playing around . I forgot . 
how could I know what else I forgot ? 
because you wanted to . you wanted this to be your wedding not your parent's . 
what ? 
stop it . I'm sorry . 
I'm sorry . I'm sorry I forgot the tent . I don't think I forgot anything else . 
are we going to do this again ? 
I wouldn't know . 
they organized this , not me . I have nothing to do with it . 
how do you figure ? 
it's a bachelor party . you sort of have to do it before the wedding . 
he is . 
he's my friend . he's not a moron . 
what are you talking about ? 
I asked you to marry me . I'm ready for marriage . that's responsibility . that's growth . 
who else ? 
you don't like Moore ? since when ? 
what does Moore have to do with your growing ? 
I've known him since Cub Scouts . 
he's quiet . 
he just doesn't talk a lot . 
he's a great chef . 
you expect more what ? 
time out . 
that's absurd . 
I'm not going to marry you with the smell of prostitutes on my body . 
you will not be common ! ! ! 
of course . 
with all my heart . 
seating problems . 
Keith do not trivialize this . 
we're supposed to have gold-trimmed padded seats , now they're telling me that there was a mistake and we can't have padded . 
not padded ones . 
you go down there . 
go down to the seat place and straighten this out . 
I need your help . 
I need your help . 
do you love me ? 
take care of those chairs . 
maybe . 
I will . 
of course . 
I love you . 
hi . 
not yet . 
I'm working on it , I've made three calls . I can't stop thinking about how much I love you . 
well you should . 
just a bit of organizing . 
yeah . nesting . 
go have fun . not too much . 
hey . it's me . 
we're on our way home . I just ... we're running a little late . 
no . just like an hour or so . 
what okay ? 
the chairs . 
you sound funny . did you do cocaine ? 
I'm working on it . 
" at first I thought it was infatuation ... But oh it's lasted so long ... " 
yeah baby . everything's great . 
yeah . sure . 
yeah . look honey , I'll be right in . I just ... we're just taking care of some groomsmen last minute business . 
are they fighting ? 
nobody's saying cancel . I'm talking about modifying . 
can we just talk this out ? 
we're not canceling . 
I won't even discuss it . 
don't we already have someone to do that for us ? 
okay . okay . 
no . 
no it's not okay . it's not . 
don't even . 
what ? 
what kind of stupid question is that ? 
what are you talking about ? 
who's dead ? 
you fucked a prostitute ? 
you killed a prostitute . 
call the police . 
my God . you've got to call the police , tell them it was an accident . where is she ? 
you left a dead prostitute out in the desert ? alone ? 
stop ! you stop right here . I don't want to know anymore . I told you not to do this bachelor Party thing . you were warned . 
no buts . I told you your friends were Jackasses . 
no buts . I've waited twenty-seven years , twenty-seven years I have focused and prepared to walk down that aisle . I will not be derailed ! I will not be embarrassed ! I will not be denied ! I am walking down that aisle tomorrow come hell or high fucking water ! 
what does that mean ? 
like how ? 
so what do we do ? 
move the bodies ? 
you and Moore move the bodies and bury Boyd with them . in fact , put Moore in the ground too . 
no ... 
but ... 
yea ... It's great ... seems like ... I don't know you've got all the important stuff in there . 
are we supposed to ? 
what ? 
I do . 
the hell you didn't ! 
you said one in two marriages end in divorce . 
Moore ? 
false . 
not true . 
I am a lover . in Africa , you can stay king as long as you can service your women every night . 
new king . 
Israel doesn't have a King . 
they have a president . a Benjamin Yahoo something . 
what's your point ? 
there's my point exactly . 
take Mexico . 
lock up the chickens , dig up the holy dirt , pack up the wailing crying wall thing they bang their heads on all day long , stick it all on a big fucking tug boat . the whole country picks up and takes Mexico . 
they need leadership . 
not really , no . 
you said nobody would miss her . 
you will not screw this up . 
ball park sausages . 
Franco Harris has a flare for the dramatic . the former Pittsburgh Steeler running back , beat known for " The Immaculate reception , " his improbable sixty yard Ricochet reception . I say Ricochet reception has made a bold move on corporate America . Harris has lead a group of investors in the purchase of the Park sausage Company . by taking on the challenge of resurrecting Park's , Harris is engaged in the equivalent of a sudden death overtime . 
he must take an open-field run to profitability through excessive debt large competitors and dwindling market share . before the clock runs out . 
we're not goosed . 
Micheal get a grip . what did you tell her ? 
Goosed ! 
Goosed ! 
come on tough guy . listen to me . you are going to tell Lois that it was all an accident . okay cowboy ? you got me ? 
well , I didn't mean it . 
who's up for making some real money ? 
no , I'm holding for Tony . in chairs . Keith Fisher . okay . 
we need padded chairs . 
no . 
shut up . 
shut up . 
well we can definitely call the police . that's an easy call . if we call the police ... What happens ? they find a dead prostitute in the bathroom ... They ask us ... What happened ? we say , ah ... our friend , Micheal ... Your brother ... got a little out of control ... they were making love ... and he got a little excited ... and he , ah , sort of beat her head into the side of a toilet , while he choked her to death with a rubber hose ... 
what's insane is the fact that Micheal here put a fucking girl's head through a toilet . that's insane . 
I'm calling the police . 
I think we should say some words over the grave . 
I'm talking about prayer . 
it goes ; " Today is the first day of the rest of our lives . " 
you always were a jealous man . 
no , the problem , as I recall , was the lack of blocking ... 
shut up Boyd . 
he's having a problem here . 
no easy Boyd ! I got a best friend in there in pieces . how about a little sensitivity ? 
he is not cracking up . 
what did you ask me ? 
I said , what have we done ? 
I don't know ! I just want to get married . 
what ? 
I just want to get married . 
you want to know what you are doing here ? ! you are love pumping . you are protecting all that is sacred and beautiful and in sync with poetry and sunsets and little newborn babies . you are walking the walk . this is it Fisher , the real stuff . you love this woman . love is second to nothing . I love you . I love Moore . I love Micheal . this car is full of love , and nothing - absolutely nothing - supersedes love , man . nothing . we will do what it takes . whatever it takes . 
does she sound pissed , scared , hostile ? did she mention the police ? 
suck my ass . 
I don't think that's such a good idea . 
what are you going to do ? 
and what does that mean ? are you insane ? ! you think I would hurt Lois ? ! she's the mother of those kids ! what is wrong with you ? 
you got a nasty side to your thought process . 
what does that mean ? 
good deal . Lois just wants to hear it from Micheal . 
that it was all an accident . she wants to hear it from Micheal's mouth . 
that's right . 
hold on a sec . Lois , you sure you wouldn't rather do this in the morning ? 
I'm getting really tired of your bullshit . 
you've got a warped thought process . your brain doesn't function properly . 
I'm talking about some bad , bad , very bad things . bad things ! those are bad fucking things ! 
fine ? fine what ? 
I'm serious . 
you're sick . 
not a prayer . 
you need help . 
fish ? 
that's the whole point . they rarely work out . but on occasion they do . and when they do , they do big . 
fine . don't come crying to Boyd . no sir . 
not tonight . 
Jack Kerouback , Herman Melville , Henry Miller and Hunter S. Thompson . I dedicate this evening to fear and to major loathing . so from sun set to sun rise , let me be heard ... 
we can take her out to Red Rock . find some quiet place ... and put her in the ground . 
here's his head . 
today is the best day of the rest of our lives . 
what is her disposition ? 
give me two more . 
he's fine . okay Mikey , let's go . you guys stay here . 
ah , yeah , hi . is Tina there ? 
I'm with Tina . is she there ? 
where is she ? 
the groom ? 
doing the bachelor party thing ? 
sin City . devil's playground . the Black Bitch . all day every day . where's Tina ? 
she's still working ? 
sweet deal . 
great . fine . perfect . 
I'm just gonna let her know I'm here . 
I don't understand where this personal attack is coming from ... 
nothing happened in Vegas . 
Micheal . tell Lois that nothing ... 
I will call the police right now if I don't start getting some answers . 
there's more . 
what does that mean ? 
well , oh ... 
so where's that leave us ? 
tomorrow . we are getting married tomorrow . 
I know you'll be . three hours . 
no ... we want padded chairs ... okay ? 
they've all been real times . and as you prepare to enter into a new phase of life , as you prepare for new roles ; father , husband , teacher , you will , as I have , come to except the letting go of of old ways . soon , the mellowing will begin ... 
right ! that's exactly what I'm saying . my father said , first of all , I'm your father not your friend . I'm your father . 
no . I think it's fucked . 
don't ever stare him down . 
don't eyeball your kids . 
I know and I'm honored ... 
I know ... 
what happened ? oh my God ... 
it has to be done . 
what . 
I don't think so . 
I got a migraine like a little monkey kicking in the side of my skull , Mike Tyson with a fucking sledge hammer trying to crack ... 
where's the bathroom ? 
they're driving me nuts ! 
they're screaming for Starbursts . 
they're screaming like monsters and it's giving me a headache . go get some fucking Starbursts . 
there is no candy ! 
four hours and fifteen minutes . I can make Vegas in 3 and change . 
you want to hear me out ? 
you can't keep bringing up Starbucks . that was your only real hit in like 75 tries . 
over eight years of some of the hardest raging experiences of my life . 
you don't know what you're doing . 
what ? 
what are you talking about ? 
just wait a second . wait one second . okay . what are you doing ? 
why ? why ? she's dead . why are you calling an ambulance ? 
why ? 
we have a dead woman bleeding all over the bathroom . what options ? call the police . 
that is not an " option . " there is no multiple choice here . 
there's more . 
just giving the facts . 
what were we doing officer ? why didn't we help her ? well ... we're all a bit high , you know , bachelor party , that kind of thing . Fisher here is getting married in three days ... Beautiful wife ... he didn't have anything at all to do with it ... It was all Micheal here ... just Micheal ... 
sure , why not . 
we can do this . we can get her out of here . 
nobody knows she's here . I called her personally . nobody knows . 
it's a marble floor , we can clean it up . 
so I didn't fucking do it ! 
you don't think someone will have a problem with a body being thrown off a balcony ? 
what about the blood ? 
have you ever done this before ? 
I'm not wrecking the transmission ! 
what ? 
we've already done this . 
according to Jewish law , the blood and limbs are considered to be part of the human being . they must be buried together or their souls won't rest in peace . 
no we're not . the bodies are all mixed up . we can't do this to them . 
that is absolutely not true . 
open the suitcases , unpack the body parts and reunite the limbs . 
I am not flexible on this . 
we are all going straight to hell . either hell or prison , whichever comes first . 
what does that mean ? 
oh I did ? I think it was your little rat fuck brother who decided to play Hamburger helper with the hooker's head . 
lighten up Adam . show some character . 
fuck you Boyd ! 
I can't do this . 
at the seven-eleven . 
they're on me . they're smoking me out ! 
I don't give a damn . 
Adam ! calm down . 
it has worked . 
they won't figure it out . 
no . I'm not Boyd . I am not cool at all . 
first of all ... 
you're interrupting a personal conversation . 
no , because your opinions are idiotic and have nothing to do with what any given conversation is about , which makes 85 % of your eagerly injected thought process highly offensive to me . 
you're an asshole . 
multiple reasons . 
I don't have to ... 
Franco mother-fucking Harris ! 
she's dead . 
playing ? 
why was the floor wet ? 
why ? ! 
it's sacrilegious . 
you're pathetic . 
you're not a team player . 
you never were a team player . that's why you never had any friends . 
the hell you do . 
you have acquaintances - business friends and superficial golf buddies . you have always been a fringe player . you have some serious male on male intimacy problems . 
and you're a little fucking reject . 
you're a loser . 
you fucking bastard ! 
don't you fucking threaten me - I'll fucking kill you . 
you go home ! 
what ? 
what did you say ? 
I didn't hear you . 
the stripper's here . 
I need a drink . 
don't touch her . call 911 . 
bullshit it's not accesory . I didn't do shit . you call the cops , you explain it was an accident ... 
that's a horrible ugly comment . " dead whore ? " she's a person ! 
we're gonna get caught . I know we're gonna get caught . they were eyeballing my car . 
not tweed -- it's a smoother material , with a larger collar and belted . 
now , Judy , it isn't anything to get -- 
I thought so ! 
how soon can it be altered ? 
can we have it by tonight ? 
yes , it is . now , I want to look at an evening dress , a dinner dress , black -- short -- long sleeves -- with a neck cut this ... ... and the skirt out . 
what does a big old wooden house on the corner of Eddy and Gough Street have to do with her ? 
by whom ? 
how ? 
thank you , Mr. Leibel . thank you very much . 
I thought you said no more aches and pains ? 
no three-way stretch ? how very un- chic . 
what's tomorrow ? 
how do you know ? personal experience ? 
what do you mean ? 
you sound so disapproving , Midge . 
I had to quit , Midge . 
I wake up at night seeing him fall from the roof ... and try to reach out for him . 
I know . everybody tells me . 
I know . I have Acrophobia . what a disease . a fear of heights . and what a moment to find out I had it . 
and sit behind a desk ? Chairborne ? 
not with my Acrophobia , Midge . if I dropped a pencil on the floor and bent down to pick it up , it could be disastrous ! 
mmm . why don't you go away for a while ? 
have you had any dizzy spells this week ? 
I've never run across one like that . 
Uh-huh ! 
what a pleasant hobby . 
that's following a train of thought . 
normal . 
you know there's only one man in the world for me , Johnny-O . 
three whole weeks . 
Gavin ? Gavin Elster ? you'd think I'd would . no . 
that's Skid Row ... isn't it ? 
he's probably on the bum and wants to touch you for the price of a drink . 
sorry , old man . work . 
what . 
I asked my doctor . he said only another emotional shock could do it , and probably wouldn't . and you're not going to go diving off another rooftop to find out . 
how ? 
what do you want me to start with -- the Golden Gate Bridge ? 
stop kidding . wait a minute . 
okay . 
this is a cinch . I look up , I look down . I look up -- 
oh , damn it ! damn it , damn it -- 
well , who ? come on , you know everybody . 
oh ! you mean Gay Old Bohemian Days of Gay Old San Francisco ! the juicy stories ? like who shot who in the Embarcadero August , 1879 ? 
pop Leibel . 
pop Leibel owns the Argosy Book Shop . what do you want to know ? 
wait a minute ! you're not a detective any more . what's going on ? 
pop Leibel ? sure . 
for what ? 
nothing to tell . 
I'll take you home . 
you haven't told me everything . 
who's the guy , who's the wife ? 
I know . the one who phoned . your old college chum , Elster . 
I'm not telling you what I think ! I'm telling you what he thinks ! 
no , not Carlotta . Elster's wife . 
bye-bye ! 
since I stopped being able to get them on the phone . for a man who has nothing to do , you're certainly a busy little bee . where do you go , these days ? 
where ? 
oh ? 
did you need it ? 
oh ? 
all I said in the note was : " where are you ? " that doesn't sound desperate to me . 
I just thought if I gave you a drink and fed you some dinner , you'd be so grateful you'd take me to a movie . 
oh ... this and that . 
if you want to . naturally , we won't talk about anything you don't want to talk about . 
what have you been doing ? 
good . I've always said you were wasting your time in the underwear department . 
what is it , a still life ? 
yes ... you run this hotel . 
would you tell me , who has the room on the second floor in the corner , that corner ? 
I can't imagine that sweet girl with that dear face -- 
Valdes . Miss Valdes . it's Spanish , you know . 
yes , that's it . sweet name , isn't it ? foreign . but sweet . 
oh , it must be two weeks . yes , the rent's due tomorrow . 
no ... she only comes to sit . two or three times a week . and I never ask questions , you know . as long as they're well behaved . I must say that I've wondered -- 
oh , but she hasn't been here today . Scottie whirls back on her . 
oh , no ! she hasn't been here at all ! I would have seen her , you know . I've been right here all the time , putting olive oil on my rubber plant leaves ! 
would you please go and look ? 
what car ? 
you ... ... fell into the Bay . 
no ... 
oh , of course I remember that ! but then I must have had a dizzy spell , and fainted ! 
at ... 
why ? 
where had you been before ? 
this afternoon . 
before ? where ? where had you been ? 
I will . you're terribly direct in your questions . 
you're not . merely direct . what were you doing there ? at Old Fort Point ? 
you like it , too . 
oh , that's a lovely spot , isn't it ? I've never been inside . but it looks so lovely , driving past . 
no . 
oh ! yes ! here ! 
I ... didn't know where you lived . 
yes , I knew which one it was . it's out there , now . but I didn't think you'd want to be brought home that way . 
that's a good , strong name . do your friends call you John ? or Jack . 
I shall call you Mr. Ferguson . 
I prefer John . there , that's done . and what do you do , John ? 
that's a good occupation . and live here ... alone ? 
some people prefer it . 
what ? 
no , never before . I've fallen into lakes , out of rowboats , when I was a little girl . and I fell into a river , once , trying to leap from one stone to another . but I've never fallen into San Francisco Bay . have you ? ever before ? 
good morning . I worried about you , last night . you shouldn't have run like that . 
I wanted to drive you home . are you all right ? 
you've nothing to apologize for . 
not at all , I enjoyed -- 
I enjoyed talking to you . 
no ! no , thank you ! 
the first time I've been grateful for Coit Tower . 
what ? 
we have . 
shopping ? 
well ... anywhere in particular ? 
ah . that's what I was going to do . 
don't you think it's sort of a waste for the two of us to ... 
no ... no , I don't think that's necessarily true . 
of course not ! I'm a Wanderer ! I'd like to go somewhere I've never been ! 
if I've been there ? that's silly ! either you've been to a place or you haven't . 
oh ... some , two thousand years , or more . 
of all the people who have been born ... and have died ... while the trees went on living . 
I don't like them . 
knowing I have to die ... 
only silence . it's always like this . 
no birds live here . 
would you like a drink of water ? 
here with you . 
the tall trees ... 
yes ... 
where ? 
tell me what it is . where do you go ? what takes you away ? 
when you jumped in the bay , you didn't know where you were . you guessed but you didn't know . 
why did you jump ? 
no , I can't tell you ! 
no ! please ! please , please , please , please , don't ask me ! 
home ? 
vaguely ... 
a room ... there is a room , and I sit there alone ... always alone ... 
what else ? 
where ? 
how do you know ? 
there's a name on the gravestone . 
what else ? 
a portrait ? do you ever see a portrait ? 
of the woman in the mirror . would you know her if you saw her ? 
no ! 
and so explain it away ? but there is a way to explain it , you see . if I'm mad ? that would explain it , wouldn't it ? 
I'm so afraid ... ... you won't let it happen ... 
all the time . 
why ? what's happened ? 
only this far . 
I didn't wake him . I don't want him to know ... 
it was the tower again ... and the bell , and the old Spanish village ... 
but clear ... so very clear ... for the first time ... all of it ... 
there was a village square , a green with trees ... and an old whitewashed Spanish church with a cloister . across the green : a big , grey , wooden house with a porch and shutters and a balcony above ... a small garden , and next to it , a livery stable ... with old carriages lined up inside . 
at the end of the green there was a whitewashed stone house with a lovely pepper tree at the corner -- 
yes ? ! but -- 
Madeleine , a hundred miles south of San Francisco there's an old Spanish Mission , Mission San Juan Bautista . it's been preserved exactly as it was a hundred years ago as a museum . now , think hard , darling . you've been there before . you've seen it ! 
I stood alone on the green , searching for something , and I started to walk to the church . but then the darkness closed in , I was alone in the dark , being pulled into darkness , and I fought to wake up ... 
and it's a all real . 
not merely as it was a hundred years ago . as it was a year ago , or six months ago , whenever you were here to see it . Madeleine , think of when you were here ! 
I love you too ... too late ... too late ... 
too late ... there's something I must do ... 
you can't . 
let me go . 
to the church , I must go there . 
please let me go . 
it had to . we're in love . that's all that counts . Madeleine -- 
Madeleine ! ! 
and if you lose me , you'll know that I loved you and wanted to go on loving you . 
let me go into the church alone . 
please . because I love you . he stares at her , sees the pleading look in her eyes , and lets go . she turns and walks away toward the church , slowly , her head bowed . he watches her go and starts to move after her . then slowly , as she goes , her head begins to go up until finally , as she walks , she is staring high above her . and then , suddenly , she breaks into a broken run . 
what for ? who are you ? 
no , there are just a few things I want to ask you , and -- 
no , I happened to see you come in , and I thought -- 
no , please ! I Just want to talk to you ! 
I'm not going to hurt you ! I promise ! please ! 
what about ? 
why ? 
you're not far wrong . 
let me come in . 
you won't have to . 
Judy Barton . 
just a girl , I work at Magnin's -- 
it's a place to live , that's all . 
about three years . 
I told you ! right here ! 
Salina , Kansas ! 
I want to know who you are . 
why ? 
no , you don't owe me anything . 
dinner ... and what else ? 
because I remind you of her ? 
well ... I've been on blind dates before ... matter of fact , to be honest , I've been picked up before . okay . 
oh , no ! give me time to change and get fixed up ! 
mmm . 
can I see you tomorrow ? 
tomorrow morning . 
don't go . 
I'll take care of you . 
oh , I understand , all right . I've been understanding since I was seventeen . and the next step is , as long as you're going to see me tomorrow , why don't you stay the night . 
no ? then what ? 
as friends ? we'd just see a lot of each other as friends , and you'd " take care of me " ? 
why ? because I remind you of someone ? that's not very complimentary . and nothing would ... happen ... 
that's not very complimentary , either . 
why ? ! 
no , there . there's a good one . do you like that ? 
honest ? 
but Scottie , you don't have to ! 
no , it's not right . 
I'm trying to buy you a suit . 
they're none of them right . 
Judy , I just want you to look nice . and I know what kind of suit would look well on you . 
Judy -- 
no , I don't want any clothes ! I don't want anything ! I want to get out of here ! 
we'll take it ! will it fit ? 
you can . 
Judy , I want to tell you : these few days have been the first happy days I've had in a year . 
no , it's you too , Judy . something in you . 
ah , no ! 
the trouble is , I'm gone now . for you . and I can't do anything about it . I want you to love me . if I let you change me , will that do it ? if I do what you tell me , will you love me ? 
all right . then I'll do it . because I don't care about me anymore . I just want you to love me . 
it should be back from your face -- with a bun at the neck . I told them . I told you . 
wherever you'd like ... 
you've got a thing about Ernie's , haven't you ? 
is that the best you can do ? 
that's what I had in mind . 
I'm going to have one of those big beautiful steaks . and ... let's see ... to start ... 
oh ! you're supposed to fasten it ! 
how does it work ? 
oh , yeah . there . 
no , it's all right . 
to complete my cure . 
I told you . I have to go back into the past . once more . for the last time . 
Madeleine died here . 
why ? 
I'm scared . 
Scottie -- 
take me away ... 
no ! 
no ! let me go ! 
you can't . you're afraid ! 
Scottie , please ... ! 
yes ! 
dead . he'd broken her neck . 
I wanted to stop it , I ran up to stop it -- 
and you were such an apt pupil ! what fun you two must have had , playing games with me ! why me ? why did he pick on me ? ! ! 
ah , yes ! I was a set-up . I was the made-to-order witness . where is he now ? 
we'll find him . 
what are you going to do ? 
some money . 
what are you going to do ? 
I was safe when you found me , there was nothing you could prove ! but when I saw you again I couldn't run away , I loved you so ! I walked into danger and let you change me again because I loved you and wanted you ! Scottie , please ! you love me now ! love me ! keep me safe ! 
too late ... too late ... there's no bringing her back . 
Scottie , what happened ? she's not home , yet . 
what happened ? 
no . she's in fine shape . nothing to worry about . but she doesn't know . you understand that . she doesn't know what she did . 
I married into it . 
no , to be honest , I find it dull . 
no . but one assumes obligations . my wife's family is all gone ; someone has to look after her interest . her father's partner runs the company yard in the East -- Baltimore -- so I decided as long as I had to work at it , I'd come back here . I've always liked it here . 
almost a year . 
San Francisco's changed . the things a that spell San Francisco to me are disappearing fast . 
I'd like to have lived here then . the color and excitement ... the power ... the freedom . 
no , I'm all right . 
no , Acrophobia isn't a crippling thing . it just means I can't climb steep stairs or go to high places , like the bar at the Top-of-the-Mark . but -- -- there are plenty of street-level bars In this town . 
no ... no , thanks . a bit early in the day for spirits . well , I guess that about covers everything , doesn't it ? I never married ; I don't see much of the " old college gang " ; I'm a retired detective -- and you're in the shipbuilding business . what's on your mind , Gavin ? 
then ? 
from whom ? 
if I told you I believe that his happened to my wife , what would you say ? 
then you're of no use to me . I'm sorry I wasted your time . thank you for coming in , Scottie . 
no , it sounds idiotic , I know . and you're still the hard-headed Scot , aren't you ? always were . do you think I'm making it up ? 
I'm not making it up . I wouldn't know how . she'll be talking to me about something , nothing at all , and suddenly the words fade into silence and a cloud comes into her eyes and they go blank ... and she is somewhere else , away from me ... someone I don't know . I call to her and she doesn't hear . and then with a long sigh she is back , and looks at me brightly , and doesn't know she's been away ... can't tell me where ... or why ... 
more and more in the past few weeks . and she wanders . God knows where she wanders . I followed her one day . 
watched her come out of the apartment , someone I didn't know ... walking in a different way ... holding her head in a way I didn't know ; and get into her car , and drive out to ... Golden Gate Park . five miles . she sat on a bench at the edge of the lake and stared across the water to the old pillars that stand an the far shore , the Portals of the past . sat there a long time , not moving ... and I had to leave , to got to the office . that evening , when I came home , I asked what she'd done all day . she said she'd driven to Golden Gate Park and sat by the lake . that's all . 
the speedometer of her car showed she had driven 94 miles that day . where did she go ? I have to know , Scottie . where she goes and what she does , before I got involved with doctors . 
yes , but carefully . I'd want to know more before committing her to that kind of care . Scottie -- 
I want you . 
Scottie , I need a friend ! someone I can trust ! I'm in a panic about this ! 
we're going to an opening at the opera tonight . we'll dine at Ernie's first . which is easier ? 
all right . you won't know what to look for at first , Scottie . even I , who know her so well , cannot tell , sometimes , when the change has begun . she looks so lovely and normal ... 
that's Carlotta Valdes . 
there are things you didn't tell me . 
but you knew about this . 
Great-grandmother . the child who was taken from her whose loss drove Carlotta mad and to her death - was Madeleine's grandmother . 
but she doesn't know , about her background . she never heard of Carlotta Valdes . 
nothing . 
she is not my wife . 
her mother told me most of then before she died . I dug out the rest for myself , here . 
natural fear . her grandmother went insane and took her own life . and the blood is in Madeleine . Scottie , I ask you to watch her closely . 
I -- I -- 
it is hard to say . six months , at least . perhaps a year . it depends to a certain extent on him . 
no . we have ways of digging out knowledge . but it takes longer . he is suffering from acute melancholia , together with a guilt complex . he blames himself for what happened to the woman . and we know little of the background . 
ah ? that complicates the problem . 
how'm I doing so far ? 
should I ? 
yes . 
the Big Boy did ... ? 
before he can get there here comes this Federal Marshal , and Franky's indicted for Jury tampering , they throw him in jail , he's gonna be disbarred , his life is over . Jimmy , gimme another drink . how are you ? 
okay . now , so he's in jail . he , finally , he gets to see the light , he calls up Harrington , he says he thinks he made a mistake . as if by magic , charges against him are dropped , he's released from jail . P.S. He's fired from the firm , his wife divorces him , he turns to drink and mopes around three and a half years . you like that story ? 
yes . 
yes , that's correct . 
yes . 
yes , the roving nurse ... 
Four-and-one-half minutes after her heart stopped . and they resume seven minutes ... 
... they start again three minutes earlier ... 
what happened in those three ... 
what happened in those three minutes ... ? 
why did it take that long to get her heartbeat ... 
wait , wait , wait , you're saying that her brain damage could have been caused by her being deprived of oxygen for two minutes ... ? 
huh . and why is that ? 
another , Frank . . . ? 
thanks , Franky . 
yeah . 
that's for sure , Frank . 
hi . how are you doing ? 
Uh-huh . my nephew's going to be staying with us in a few months , so I stopped by . 
four . you're great with these kids . 
you're really ... You , are you the one they told me was the nurse ? 
Mrs ... 
yes . 
that's a wonderful profession . my daughter-in-law's a nurse . what did you do , stop ? 
yes ... 
yes . 
these are your initials ,' K.C.' ? 
d'you ask the patient when did she last eat ? 
what did she say ? 
yes . 
I did . 
yes . 
I , what are you talking about ? I talked to her this morning , and she said ... 
she did ? 
in New York ? 
you saw Kat in New York ... ... or is she in town ? is she in town ... ? 
it's locked . 
... we , we love her , Dick and me ... 
but what can we do ? she don't know who's visiting her ... 
... You saw her ? 
you know how beautiful she was ? her husband left her , and he took her kids .... They , they , they'd let you die in there . they don't care . nobody cares . the Patriot Home , the Chronic Care ... in Arlington ... ? they'd take her in . perpetual care . they'd take her . fifty thousand dollars they want . an endowment . 
I don't want to leave her . Dick ... the , the ... and Father Laughlin , he said that it was God's will ... 
my doctor told me that I got to move out West ... that's when we filed in court . we didn't want to sue ... 
... But Dick , he's looking for two years in Tucson ... and they called him up and said to come out . he's a good man . he's only trying to do what's right . 
... and I have inquiries out to doctors , experts in the field ... there is , of course , a problem getting a doctor to testify that another doctor's negligent ... 
I'm going to see you get that chance . 
we , yes . yes . they , they present their side , and I get the same chance . to cross-examine ... to ... to ... 
yes . 
what the hell do you think you're doing ... ? what's going on here ... ? 
fuck you . I got a call today from Sally Doneghy ... 
... You're' sposed to be in court in ten days and she's telling me you haven't even met with them ... 
one lousy letter eighteen months ago . . . .I try to throw a fuckin' case your way ... 
... I get these people to trust you --they're coming here tomorrow by the way --I get this expert doctor to talk to you . I'm doing all your fuckin' legwork -- and it's eighteen months . you're' sposed to be in court . I bet you haven't even seen the file . 
what do you want ? 
don't touch anything .

And you calm down , all right ? their guy , Towler's , the author of the book ,' Methodology and Practice , Anesthesiology .' ... and they got depositions from the nurses , everybody in the operating room , the scrub-nurse ...' All these guys are God . I saw them walk on water ...' 
no .

I'm getting it back . don't worry about me , Mick . I'm fine . d'you find the obstetric nurse ? 
so what ? 
they still have to take it to a jury . 
so what do you want me to do ? Concannon's going to try the case his way , I'm going to try it mine . you want me to go wee wee wee all the time because he's got some flack , got stories in the newspaper . I'm going to win this case .

the Doctors .

who ? they're all testifying . everybody who was in the O.R.' s going to take the stand . 
what difference can that make ... ? all right ... 
what did she do ? 
the' History' ... ? 
the broad has disappeared ... 
... you need some old forms that she had ... somebody's dying ... 
hello . this is Mr. Dorchester in Records . we're looking for Kathy Costello ... 
we got to talk . 
come on , we'll get a cup of coffee ... 
I don't know . 
I don't want a mistrial . 
Dr. Gruber's not in . 
he's not in , Sir . 
no , no , no . I have to talk to him . if I can only call him .. 
still looking . 
I changed my room at the Hotel . 
the TV didn't work . 
and what are you ? a cop ? 
my ex-husband was a lawyer . 
yes . it was , actually . 
who says I'm the one that called it off ? 
Laura . 
what if it wasn't you that I came back to see ? 
I think I will . 
and are they going to get it ? 
maybe what ? 
and is that what you're going to do ? is that what you're going to do ... ? 
what ... ? 
we , we ... No ... we just had a small reversal in the case ... I have some , uh ... I have some work to do ... 
they , uh , they got to my witness . 
I've got to work ... 
why don't you get some rest ? 
you can't work if you can't think . you get in bed . it's all right . I'll stay here with you . it's all right . come on ... 
yes . 
isn't there something you ... 
you're talking like a drunk . 
and it's over ... ? 
well , then what are you doing here ? 
you do what you want . you want to leave ... You want to go kill yourself ? 
you want me to tell you it's your fault ? it probably is . what are you going to do about it ? I thought it's not over till the jury comes in . 
you told me so . maybe you'd get some sympathy . you came to the wrong place . 
maybe I'll tell you later . 
not if you don't grow up ... 
you're like a kid , you're coming in here like it's Saturday night , you want me to say that you've got a fever -- you don't have to go to school ... 
oh , yes , I do , Joe . believe me . you say you're going to lose . is it my fault ? listen ! the damned case doesn't start until tomorrow and already it's over for you ! 
what is your wife's picture doing by the side of your ... 
what would you like it to be to me ... ? I , I , I can't invest in failure . 
stop pressuring me ... 
yes . we've all got to let go . 
what are you going to do ? 
I have to talk to you . 
Mr. Alito , please . 
I have to reach him . this is an emergency . could you give me his home number ? 
... Would you , would you call him up . I'll give you my number , and ask him ... 
I understand . thank you , my name is Galvin . I'll be at the following number in a half an hour . it's urgent . 
let me talk to Mickey . 
if you're selling something , I'm late for work ... 
from the magazine ? 
how come you're calling me from ... ? 
yes . price ... 
we find that your subscription lapsed ... 
that's why I'm calling , Miss Price ... 
we have a renew-your-subscription offer ... 
yes , we know that you do . I have it in my files . that's at the Manhattan Health Center ... 
why is that ? 
this is a complicated case , your Honor ... 
my client can't walk , your Honor . 
... things change . 
and it seems to me , a fella's trying to come back , he'd take this settlement , and get a record for himself . I myself would take it and run like a thief . 
thank you for seeing me . 
I need an extension for my case . 
that happens . 
I don't have a week . this case never should have come to trial . you know better . you're Mr. independent . you want to be independent ? be independent now . I've got no sympathy for you . 
ready , your Honor . 
what ? 
if I may be permitted to question my own witness in my own way ... 
listen to me , fella ... 
Galvin , look , many years ago ... 
are you done ? 
you aren't going to get a mistrial , boy . we're going back this afternoon , we're going to try this case to an end . now you get out of here before I call the Bailiff and have you thrown in jail . 
Mr. Concannon ... ? 
Overruled ... 
noted . thank you . Miss Costello was a rebuttal witness . her sole rebuttal was the document , which has been disallowed ... 
I told the guy I didn't want to talk to ... 
no . 
... you got your doctor's testimony . why do you need me ? 
I've got nothing to say to you . 
nothing happened . 
who put my client in the hospital for life . 
who are you protecting , then ? 
I do . who is it ? the Doctors . what do you owe them ? 
then why don't you testify ? 
you think I'm pushy now , wait' til I get you on the stand ... 
Dr. Gruber ... 
I appreciate--a man as busy as-- 
... Deborah Ann Kaye ... 
right . who called ? 
... and you're going to do that ? 
you're going to settle out of court ? 
why ? 
her doctors killed her . 
her doctors murdered her . they gave her the wrong anaesthetic and they put her in the hospital for life . her doctors murdered her . 
I read the file . yeah . Marx and Towler . I know who they were . 
whose side are you arguing ... ? I thought that you wanted to do something . I don't have any interest in the woman's' estate' -- No offense , but we all know where the money's going to ... I have an interest in the Hospital ; and I don't want those bozos working in the same shop as me . they gave her the wrong anesthetic . they turned the girl into a vegetable . they killed her and they killed her kid . you caught' em . now : how many others did they kill ? 
what are they going to do ? not invite me to their Birthday party ... ? look , I gotta go . I have to be in Cambridge ... 
okay . I'll meet you here . Tuesday night ... I gotta go . you going my way ? 
I understand . 
uh , why , why are you doing this ? 
yes . I wrote it . 
I. Yes . it is . 
yes . 
she threw up in her mask , yes . but she hadn't eaten one hour prior to admission . 
negligent . yes ... it would have been criminal . but that was not the case . 
it was good of you to meet ... 
that's what I'd planned to ... 
from what I've seen , Mr. Galvin , you have a very good case ... 
... I made a reservation at ... 
... What difference would ... 
there's nothing they can do to me . 
now , Dr. Towler's testified that they restored the heartbeat within three or four minutes . in your opinion is his estimate correct ? 
no , you did fine . 
no . no thank you , Doctor . you go home . 
yes ... I ... yes . 
no . no . thank you . you go home . 
well ... 
I ... given the limits of your question , that's correct . 
I ... um ... 
why is that ? 
... that's what the sister said . the chart said she ate nine hours prior to ... 
is that what a good doctor would do ? how old are you , please ? 
I am on the staff of ... 
... I made a detailed physical examination of the patient , Sir , yesterday evening , I ... 
actually , yes . it's by no means bad , I ... 
&apos; code Blue' ... 
... that's all right . 
I doubt we'll have to go to trial ... 
I completely understand ... 
it's completely done on a contingency basis . that means whatever the settlement is I retain one-third ... that is , of course , the usual arrangement ... 
hold on a second . 
it's all right , Mickey . 
I swear to you I wouldn't have turned the offer down unless I thought that I could win the case ... 
I'm going to win this case ... Mist ... Mr. Doneghy ... I'm going to the Jury with a solid case , a famous doctor as an expert witness , and I'm going to win eight hundred thousand dollars . 
if I could accept the offer right now , I would . they took it back . 
it's a crime . 
you would not ... ? 
in fact , you've just taken an oath that you would not commit perjury . you've just sworn to that . isn't that right ? 
just now ... 
... sworn before God you would tell the truth ? 
now . I'd like to ask you something : four years ago , when you were working as a nurse , are you aware that Drs. Towler and Marx based their treatment of Deborah Ann Kaye on this chart that you signed . . . ? 
and wasn't that an oath ... ? these are your initials here : K.C. When you signed this chart you took an oath . no less important than that which you took today . isn't that right ? isn't that right ... ? 
then , please , which is correct ? you've sworn today the patient ate one hour ago . four years ago you swore she ate nine hours ago ? which is the lie . when were you lying ? 
you know these doctors could have settled out of court . they wanted a trial . they wanted to clear their names . 
&apos; they lied .' indeed ! when did they lie ? and do you know what a lie is ? 
you swore on this form that the patient ate nine hours ago . 
you've just said you signed it . 
you didn't write that figure . and how is it that you remember that so clearly after four years ? 
I thought I would need it . 
after , after the operation , when that poor girl , she went in a coma . Dr. Towler called me in . he told me he had five difficult deliveries in a row and he was tired , and he never looked at the admittance form . and he told me to change the form . he told me to change the one to a nine . or else , or else , he said ... He said he'd fire me . he said I'd never work again .... Who were these men ... ? who were these men ... ? I wanted to be a nurse ... 
huh ! 
nothing further , your Honor . 
I'll rule on that presently . proceed . 
you may step down . 
... one moment , Mr. Concannon ... 
thank you , your Honor . further : Ms. Costello is a rebuttal witness . as a' surprise witness' she may only serve to rebut direct testimony . as her only evidentiary rebuttal was the admitting form , which has been disallowed I request that her entire testimony be disallowed and the jury advised that they must totally disregard her appearance here . 
Dr. Thompson , just so the Jury knows , you never treated Deborah Ann Kaye . is that correct ? 
engaged to render an opinion . for a price . is that correct ? you're being paid to be here today ? 
are you board-certified in anesthesiology , Doctor ? 
... I'm sure it is , but this is Massachusetts , Doctor . certified in Internal Medicine ? 
Neurology ? 
Orthopedics ? 
do you know Dr. Robert Towler ... ? 
how is that ? 
what book is that ? 
... of Anesthesiology ? 
how old are you ? 
Uh-huh . still practice a lot of medicine ? 
yes , we've heard that . doctor : you testify quite a bit against other physicians ? isn't that right ? you , you're available for that ? when you're paid to be there ? 
do you , indeed . I'll bet you do . fine . fine . we'll save the court the time . we will admit the Doctor as an' expert witness ,' fine . 
objection . 
Frank Galvin . we've met before . 
... to get her heartbeat back ... ? 
... almost nine minutes ... causing brain damage . 
and you would come here , and on a slip of memory four years ago , you'd ruin their lives . 
don't equivocate . be positive . just tell the truth . 
yes . 
I was her doctor . 
... I was one of a group of ... 
yes . 
yes . 
when she ... 
Dr. Towler , who was in the operating room with you ? 
&apos; code Blue ,' what does that mean ... ? 
why wasn't she getting oxygen ... ? 
tell me one ? 
she threw UP IN HER mask . let's cut the bullshit . say it : she threw UP IN HER mask . 
and what did your team do ... 
... You brought thirty years of medical experience to bear . isn't that what you did ? 
... A patient riddled with complications , questionable information on her , on her admitting form ... 
... to save her and to save the baby . is that ... 
you reached down into death . now , isn't that right ? 
tell us . 
Mickey told me to come back to work . 
... that was a Dr. David Gruber's office ... 
Mickey told him to call .' he's some very hotshot surgeon at Mass . Commonwealth . he wants to meet with you at seven tonight re testimony in the case of Deborah Ann Kaye . you meet him at the hospital .' 
it looks that way . 
... a Mrs. Doneghy called ... I told you that . 
Frank Galvin's ... who's calling please ? Bishop Brophy's office ... 
what does it mean ? 
does that mean I'm back for awhile ? 
how did you settle on the amount ? 
you thought it was just . 
because it struck me how neatly' three' went into the amount . two Hundred Ten Thousand . that would mean I keep seventy . 
yes . it would be . 
and no one will know the truth . 
that that poor girl put her trust in the hands of two men who took her life , she's in a coma , her life is gone . she has no family , she has no home , she's tied to a machine , she has no friends --and the people who should care for her : her Doctors , and you , and me , have been bought off to look the other way . we have been paid to look the other way . I came in here to take your money . I brought snapshots to show you . so I could get your money . I can't take it . if I take it . if I take that money I'm lost . I'm just going to be a rich ambulance chaser . I can't do it . I can't take it . 
accused . not indicted . he resigned the firm . divorced nineteen seventy . Galvin worked with Michael Morrissey until Morrissey retired in' seventy-eight . since then he's been on his own . four cases before the Circuit Court . he lost them all . he drinks . 
the man's an ambulance chaser ... 
this is a nuisance suit . he's looking for small change . he's asking for six hundred thousand and betting we don't want to go to court . 
neither does he . that's where he loses . this man's scared to death to go to court . we only have to call his bluff . 
no . absolutely , and we're going to see that it is not . 
all right . but let's keep the price down . I've called Ed Concannon . he recommends that we continue to respond as if we're going to trial . 
well , of course , it's always dangerous ... 
yes . 
she's the only nurse who isn't testifying for the Doctors . 
nothing . 
very good . 
as far as we know , nothing . 
Abrams ... 
I'm fine . 
yes . 
the district attorney's office will comply provided - 
May-I be frank , Counselor ? I suspect your political power as much as I respect it . I don't know why Mr. Kint has so many faceless allies in City Hall , and I don't care . the embarrassment he helped cause the city of New York will not happen here . 
then prosecute . I will be very impressed to see if the District Attorney manages to bring in twenty-seven simultaneous counts of murder against one man with cerebral palsy . I would think a man with your job would agree with these alleged &amp; quot ; faceless people in City Hall &amp; quot ; you mention . 
Mr. Kint will plead guilty to weapons possession . 
weapons . Misdemeanor one . 
counselor , you're bluffing . shall I push for misdemeanor two ? 
sure . and I appreciate that . and I want to help you , Agent Kujan . I like cops . I would have liked to have been a Fed myself but my C.P. was - 
I told the D.A. everything I know . 
I know he was good . 
sure . fifteen years ago , but he was a good thief Anyway , the cops wouldn't let him go legit . 
you trying to get a rise out of me , Agent Kujan ? 
that's been suppressed . anything in there is inadmissible . 
well I do have the weapons charge . I'm looking at six whole months hard time . 
you know a religious guy named John Paul ? 
he didn't have my lawyer . 
I' 11 be sure to mention that to him . 
no . 
I'm not a rat . 
you wanted to know what happened after the line-up , I'm telling you . 
he loved her . 
that was all Fenster and McManus . 
you keep trying to lay this whole ride on t Keaton . it wasn't like that . sure he knew , but Edie had him all turned around. r I'm telling you straight , I swear . + 
you got him wrong . 
I don't think you do . but you say you saw Keaton die . I think you're covering his ass and he's still out there somewhere . I think he was behind that whole circus in the harbor . my bet is he's using you because you're stupid and you think he's your friend . you tell me he's dead , so be it . I want to make sure he's dead before I go back to New York . 
what lawyer ? 
the D.A. gave me immunity . 
there was a lawyer . Kobayashi . 
no . but I'm sure Keaton's dead . 
Kobayashi . 
right . 
Keaton always said : &amp; quot ; I don't believe in God , but I'm afraid of him . &amp; quot ; Well I believe in God , and the only thing that scares me is Keyser SOZE . 
and this is why you never told the D.A. 
turn state's evidence . take the stand on this and we'll hear it out . 
if there is a Keyser Soze he'll be looking for you . 
so why play into his hands ? we can protect you . 
this is totally irrelevant . 
can we just get back to Kobayashi ? 
you're stalling , verbal . 
what happened ? 
McManus was furious . he was talking about tracking him down and ripping his heart out and all sorts of shit . that night we got the call . 
why didn't you say anything ? 
wait a minute . 
I don't . 
you KNOW . you'VE known THIS WHOLE FUCKING TIME . give IT TO ME . 
then why didn't you help him ? 
but Keaton ... 
I never heard of him . 
I said I never heard of him . 
I don't 
but how - wait . you're saying SOZE sent t us to kill someone ? 
why did he want you to live ? a one-time dirty cop without a loyalty in the world finds it in his heart to save a worthless rat-cripple ? no , sir . why' 
I don't buy that reform story for a minute . and even if I did , I certainly don't believe he would send you to protect her . so why ? 
no , verbal . you weren't friends . Keaton didn't have friends . he saved you because he wanted it that way . it was his will . 
Keaton was Keyser Soze 
the kind OF MAN THAT COULD HAVE KILLED Edie FINNERAN . 
he used all of you to get him on that boat . he couldn't get on alone and he had to pull the trigger himself to make sure he got his man . the one man that could identify him . 
he left you to stay behind and tell us he was dead . you saw him die , right ? or did you ? you had to hide when the first police cars showed up . you heard the shot , just before the fire but you didn't see him die . 
he programmed you to tell us just what he wanted you to . Customs has been 
it was all Keaton . we followed him from the beginning . 
why lie about everything else , then ? 
you're not safe on your own . 
is he Keyser Soze I don't know , verbal . it seems to me that Keyser sate is a shield . like you said , a spook story , but I know Keaton - and someone out there is pulling strings for you . stay here and let us protect you . 
I' 11 take my chances , thank you . it's tougher to buy the cheapest bag-man than it is to buy a cop . 
maybe so , but I'm no rat , Agent Kujan . you tricked me , that's all . I won't keep my mouth shut' cause I'm scared . I' 11 keep it shut' cause I let Keaton down by getting caught - Edie Finneran too . and if they kill me , it's 
this won't be an' interrogation , just a ... friendly chat to kill time . 
if it was a dope deal , where's the dope , if it was a hit , who called it in ? 
you know damn well what I think . 
I don't think he does . not exactly , but there's a lot more to his story . I want to know why twenty-seven men died on that pier for what looks to be ninety-one million dollars worth of dope that wasn't there . above all , I want to be sure that Dean Keaton is dead . 
Kobayashi . 
the D.A. came down here last night ready to arraign before they even moved him to county . Kint's lawyer comes in and five minutes later , the D.A. comes out looking like he'd been bitch-slapped by the boogey man . they took his statement and cut him a deal . 
weapons . Misdemeanor two . 
I want to see him . 
someplace else , then . 
I know what I wanted to know about Keaton . 
Keyser sate or not , if Keaton's alive he'll never come up again . 
waste of time . 
what ? 
we're on vacation . 
a friend of mine in New York tells me you knew spook Hollis . 
I shivved him . 
business or personal ? 
you didn't know . 
who is he ? 
we want to meet him . 
tell him we'll meet . 
who's your boss ? 
don't jerk me off . we all know what this is . you don't work with me if I work with you without knowing who I'm working for . now let's cut the shit . who's the man ? 
you set up the line-up . 
what about Redfoot ? 
Mr. Soze will be most - 
a strange threat . I can only assume you're here to kill me anyway . pity about Mr. Redfoot . 
we know you can get to us , and now you know we can get to you . I'm offering you the chance to call this off . 
neither do we . 
we'll see . 
Edie Finneran . she is upstairs in my office for an extradition deposition . I requested she be put on the case personally . she flew out yesterday . 
you're lying . 
how are you , Keaton ? 
ready ? 
this I had to see myself . 
you know damn well , dead-man . 
you were waiting for a line-up then , too . what happened with that ? 
I wanted to talk to you . the other guys - 
they're gonna do a job . three million dollars , maybe more . 
if you'll just let me - 
hurt you , you sonofabitch ? I could kill you . 
McManus has a friend in the fourteenth Precinct . they're coming out for one job - Thursday . they're picking up a guy smuggling emeralds out of South America . Fenster and McManus have a fence set to take the stuff . 
some guy in California . his name is Redfoot . 
you have to come . 
they - They don't know me . you do . they won't take me unless you go . look at me . I need this . 
okay , okay . you say it's the real thing ? that's cool . 
you okay ? 
well , I'm sorry . 
how are they going to do it ? 
Fenster and Hockney ? 
three million ? 
no killing ? 
we'll make it . 
we'll make it . 
something - I don't know . I ever tell you about the restaurant I wanted to open ? 
who's Keyser Soze ? 
Russian , I think . I don't know . 
I want you to find Edie . both of you find some place safe . tell her what happened - Everything . she knows people . she'll know what to do . if we can't get Kobayashi my way , she'll get him her way . 
just do what I tell you . 
Hockney was just a bad bastard . good with explosives . mean as a snake when it mattered . 
did you hear what he just said ? 
the word I got is you hung up your spurs , man . what's that all about ? 
how do I know that ? how about it , pretzel-man ? what's your story ? 
dig . 
can we Stealth these guys ? 
you are a criminal . 
then who goes ? 
right THERE . freeze . 
they fucking know everything . 
the way I hear it , Soze is some kind of butcher . no pity . 
do your friend a favor , Fenster , keep him quiet . 
this whole thing was a shakedown . 
so why the hell was I hauled in and cavity searched tonight ? 
I had a guy's fingers in my asshole tonight . 
I don't want to know . 
I don't know . who was that guy that used to talk about Soze in New York ? 
I don't know . this is bad . 
I hope I didn't disturb you . 
umm ... 
I'm having a stroke . 
just forget about it . 
Edie , please . I don't want to hear this right now . what did Renault and Fortier say ? 
goddamnit . 
time for what , Edie ? time to look into me a little more , that's what . no matter how well you cover my tracks now , they'll find out who I am . 
no . it's never going to stop , period . it won't take more than a week before every investor in this city is walking away from us . it's finished . I'm finished . 
they'll never stop . 
they ruined me tonight . 
alright . 
I don't know what you came here for , but we won't have any part of it . 
&amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; We were there to buy a man and take him back to Hungary . &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; 
&amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; I'll tell you everything . I' 11 even say it slow enough for you to understand it . just tell this man I want protection . real protection . &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; 
no good . he needs guarantees . he says ... his life is in danger ... He has seen the Devil ... looked him in the eye . 
he says he knows his face . he sees it when he closes his eyes . 
+ The nose is sharper . smaller too . + &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; And what about the hair ? you said something earlier about it . &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; 
&amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; Are you sure ? &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; 
he says the hair is longer and lighter . 
I've been looking all over for you . you still after the coke that walked out of that blood bath in the harbor ? 
you can stop looking . there was no coke . I've been in L.A. county with a guy they 
we know , but our man says no way on the dope . this Hungarian tells me the whole bunch was pulling stumps for Turkey the next' day . they had no time to negotiate that kind of product and no means to move it . 
he didn't know . no one doing the deal knew except a few key people . this guy says they were real hush about it . whatever it was it was highly sensitive . 
they tell me you got the cripple from New York in there . he mention Keyser Soze 
bear with me here ... 
and ? 
there's more . 
thought you was followin' me . 
I seen two fellas followin' me , I guessed they come to kill me . we didn't talk about no other fella . 
nothin's bent . 
you gonna share your half with him ? 
oh , them . hell , I seen them . 
yeah ? 
more . 
fuck you . 
I ain't blind , you asshole . 
yeah . 
I don't like the question . 
how many you killed , Kid ? 
plenty of times . 
move the candle closer , I can't see . 
he ain't as tough as you , Kid . 
that was your idea , I wanted to ... 
three days ? we could kill' em tomorrow . 
all of it . about him , an' you an' Uncle Pete ... about robbin' the Rock Island Pacific ... an' about them Missouri Banks . 
maybe . 
we'll bury him . 
you mean , am I gonna help you kill them cowboys ? 
an' if I spot' em ? 
just like that ? 
yeah ? 
two more hogs got the fever . 
three . 
that fella come by ... Tom . 
the one you rode out after ... the one that had the pistol ... 
only he wasn't carryin' no pistol this time . 
Tom ? only how ... how if you didn't ... didn't come back in a week ... how we was to take half the money to Sally an' say you was ... 
did you ... did you ... ? 
all that money ... I mean ... did you ... ? 
no ... I meant ... 
K-k-kill somebody ? 
N-nobody ... only you took your shotgun an' that pistol an' ... 
I guess you didn't kill nobody then . 
we ain't bad men no more , Bill . hell , we're farmers . 
how long since you shot a gun at a man ? nine ... ten years ? 
easy , huh ? hell , I don't know that it was all that easy then ... an' we was young an' full of beans . Bill ... if you was mad at' em ... if they done you wrong ... I could see shootin'' em ... 
well , we thought we was doin' it for money ... What'd they do anyhow ? cheat at cards , steal some strays , spit on a rich fella ? 
well , I guess they got it comin' ... But you wouldn't go if Claudia was alive . 
two weeks , I guess . 
yeah , an' I could still hit a bird in the eye flyin' . 
we'll come across him tomorra , I guess . 
well , it ain't just the bed I'm gonna miss . I'm ... Hell , Billy , I'm sorry . I didn't mean ... 
Sally ? 
it's just ... she's a Indian an' Indians ain't ... overfriendly . 
well , she ... 
you was a ... a crazy sonofabitch . 
you ain't like that no more . 
nor Quincy , I guess . 
you ain't like that no more . 
say , Bill ... You ever ... ever go into town ... an' all ? 
no . I mean ... ... an' get yourself a woman ? you know ? 
Whaddaya do , just use your hand ? 
yeah . 
he ain't shootin' our way no more . he's shootin' over that way . who's he shootin' at over that way ? 
you suppose maybe we're in somebody's field ? 
you're marking us , Bill . 
is THAT YOU , KID ? 
hey KID , IT'S ME , BILL MUNNY . 
better'n you anyhow , Kid . you wasn't comin' close . 
how far kin you see ? 
yeah ... you said that last night . 
God damn it , Bill , it's rainin' . 
what he was talkin' about ... how them deputies had the drop on you an' Pete ... 
I remember how there was three of them deputies you shot ... not two . 
you still think it'll be easy shootin' them cowboys ? 
huh ? uh ... yeah . 
he's dead , Bill . 
Jesus , Bill , you got fever . take a drink , will you ? 
listen , Bill , I'm gonna see what's takin' The Kid so long . must be he's gettin' an advance offa them sportin' ladies .

Supposin' he don't go to the ranch ? 
I ain't waitin' , Bill . I'll look in on your youngsters when I get back . 
you ain't shot . 
you sure you ain't armed ? 
a writer ? what do you write ... letters an' such ? 
yeah . 
huh ? 
yeah ?

same one as shot Charlie Pepper in Lake County ? 
hold on , mister . son , this here pig gotta be moved outta this pen , away from them others . penny , you give yer brother a hand ... 
I could of ... easy . 
like I was sayin' you don't look like no meaner than hell cold-blooded damn killer . 
well , Uncle Pete said you was the goddamndest meanest sonofabitch ever lived an' if I ever wanted a partner for a killin' , you was the worst one . meanin' the best . on account of you're cold as snow an' don't have no weak nerve nor fear . 
I'm a damn killer myself , only I ain't killed so many as you because of my youth . Schofield Kid , they call me . 
on account of my Schofield model Smith and Wesson pistol . 
well , how about it ? 
bein' my partner . I'm headin' North up around the Niobrara in Nebraska . gonna kill a couple of no good cowboys . 
for cuttin' up a lady . they cut up her face an' cut her eyes out , cut her ears off an' her tits too . 
thousand dollars of reward . five hundred a piece . 
well ... you don't look so prosperous . hell , you could buy her a new dress out of your half . we could kill them two an' you could buy your wife one of them fancy ... 
huh ? 
oh . 
I don't never see nobody anyhow . 
wasn't nothin' said about no partner . 
I was gonna kill them two by myself . it don't take three . 
no . 
he's my partner . he don't go , I don't . 
huh ? 
lookin' at ? 
bet your ass I kin see fifty yards an' I kin shoot this sonofabitch ... 
say , Bill . that business in Jackson County ... did that really happen ? I mean how they say it happened ? 
an' how there was two deputies up close pointin' rifles at you ... had you dead to rights ... an' how you pulled out a pistol an' blew them both away to hell ... an' only took a scratch yourself . Uncle Pete told me he never seen nothin' like it , shootin' your way out of a scrape like that . 
you don't recollect ! 
he ain't dead ? you didn't get him ? 
he's clear of the horse , Ned . better get him . 
if he gets behind them rocks we ain't gonna get him ... not without we go down there . 
what happened , did you hit him ? 
you missed him ? you didn't ... ? 
yeah . 
after a ways . 
shut up , Kid . 
you still think he's in there ? 
well , he's holding on to his shit like it was money . 
tell me right off if you see him . 
you can shoot him . 
Yup . 
yeah . 
I can't see' em . 
shit ... I thought they was gonna get us . I was even ... scared a little ... just for a minute . was you ever scared in them days ? 
yeah . 
first one what ? 
yeah ? 
well , that fella today , you shot him alright . 
take a drink , Kid . 
it's a hell of a thing , ain't it , killin' a man . you take everythin' he's got ... an' everythin' he's ever gonna have ... 
we all got it comin' , Kid . 
well , you don't wanna trust me too much . we'll take Ned his share together so you don't figure I run off with it . 
Lemmee see it . 
you better get on back , Miss . 
I thought you wanted to buy spectacles an' fancy clothes an' all . 
are you ... Are you gonna ... kill Little Bill ? 
stay clear of folks you might see . there's plenty out lookin' to hang you . go on now , skedaddle . 
Silky an' Faith , they rode off to the East an' two deputies was followin' them . 
he's ... he's dead . 
they ... they killed him . I ... thought you know that . I thought you knew because ... 
he hanged him ? shot him down ? 
good example ! good example of what I'd like to know ? he didn't even kill nobody ... he couldn't do it no more . 
a sign on him ? 
they got a sign on him in front of Greely's ? 
about where you an' him was ... an' where you was from ... an' what your names was ... an' ... 
L-lies ... at first . about how you was just passin' through and didn't kill nobody ... an' Little Bill kept askin' questions , mixin' him up , catchin' lies ... an' then he'd beat on Ned an' Ned would cry and lie some more an' then ... then ... 
a cowboy come in sayin' you killed Quick Mike in the shit house at the Bar T ... 
not on purpose . but he started hurtin' him worse ... makin' him tell stuff . first Ned wouldn't say nothin' ... but Little Bill hurt him so bad he said who you was ... 
didn't scare Little Bill though , did it ? 
Lemmee see that Schofield , Kid . 
N-no . I wr-wr-wr-write ... I wr- wrwrite ... 
a book , huh ? I guess that means you can read ... An' I guess you boys seen them signs about surrendering your firearms ... But then , like you told old Andy there , you ain't armed , are you , Bob ? 
D-d-d-duke . the D-d-duke of Death . 
uh ... Duke . 
well , Mister Beauchamp ... from what I read of this here book , I'd have to say the writin' ain't a whole lot different from the pitcher . 
meaning the duck himself , I guess . 
I believe that to be an accurate description of the events , sir ... albeit there is a certain poetry to the language which ... 
you were there ? 
but he was called ... 
bam ! that Walker Colt blew up in his hand ... which was a failing common to that model . now if Corky would have really had two guns instead of just a big dick he could have defended himself to the end . 
well he wasn't gonna wait for Corky to grow no new hand . he walked over real close , bein' drunk , an' shot him through the liver . 
he will be hurryin' and he will miss . that there is as fast as I can pull an' aim an' hit anythin' more'n ten feet away ... unless it's a barn . 
then he will kill you . that is why there are so few dangerous men like old Bob there ... an' like me . it ain't so easy to shoot a man anyhow ... an' if the sonofabitch is shootin' back at you ... well , it'll unnerve most fellas . look here , let me show you somethin' . see this here pistol ? 
is ... is it ... loaded ? 
give it to him . 
did you ... kill him ? 
huh ? oh . another one , huh ? shit , I guess I'm clean out of receptacles . 
what ? 
ordinance says you got to turn in your firearms to the County office day or night . I guess you didn't read it with the weather an' all . 
them friends of yours in the back , they carryin' pistols ? 
you're spillin' your whiskey , mister . 
what's your name ? 
well , Mister Hendershot , if I was to call you a no good sonofabitch an' a liar , an' if I was to say you shit in your pants on account of a cowardly soul ... well , I guess then , you would show me your pistol right quick an' shoot me dead , ain't that so ? 
I guess you just carry it for snakes an' such . 
there ain't no snakes in here , Mister Hendershot . 
I guess you are Three-Fingered Jack out of Missouri , killer of women and children . 
I don't ... deserve this ... to die this way . I was ... building a house . 
I'll see you ... in hell , you three fingered asshole . 
no ? 
property . 
you figure nobody'll want to fuck her . 
you boys are off of the Spade outfit . got your own string of ponies ? 
huh ? Hullo , skinny . snuck up on me . how do you like her ? 
roof ? Jesus , skinny , I done practically every damn thing myself . Roberts boy hauled wood , that's all . 
porch . I'm puttin' a porch on her so's I can puff my pipe of an evening an' drink my coffee an' watch the sun set . 
them whores , they been fuckin' an' fuckin' all them cowboys that come into town the last two weeks ... 
... They been fuckin'' em ,' an tellin' every bow-legged one of' em how they're payin' a thousand dollars to whatever sonofabitch kills them two boys which cut up Delilah . 
Yup . 
I didn't hear nothin' till last night . 
oh , shit , Bill , I guess nobody's gonna come clear from Texas . 
you know how women kin lie ... I knock' em around a little , ask' em where the money is , they say they don't have none ? ... but they coulda squirreled away that much , the five of' em . maybe . 
you could run off them two cowboys . 
well , I guess they'll just up an' run anyhow , them two . 
alive ? 
he admit it ? 
those cowboys messin' him up ? 
you an' Andy get the hell out there . find out where them other two went . 
shit and fried eggs . 
little Bill , I thought you were dead . I see you shaved off your chin whiskers . 
what I heard was that you fell off your horse drunk and broke your neck . 
WW Beauchamp ... Little Bill Daggett and ... " friends . " 
oh . 
I guess not , Bob . I don't like guns around . 
be careful with those , sonny . 
enemies , Bob ? you been talking about the Queen again ? on Independence Day ? 
you ain't dead . 
I didn't mean no offense . I guess you're the one them cowboys cut up . Ned an' The Kid , my partners , are they ... ? 
scouting ? 
oh . how long I been here ? 
three days ? I must be . 
I brought your hat . you ... left it down at Greely's . 
yeah , I guess . there's still a payment , ain't there ? 
advances ? 
Alice an' Silky gave them ... free ones . 
me ? no . no , I guess not . 
I ... I guess not . I didn't mean I didn't want one' cause of you bein' cut up . I didn't mean that . 
your wife ? 
I admire that , you being true to your wife . I've seen a lot of ... of men ... who weren't . 
uh ... yeah . yeah . she's uh ... watchin' over the little ones . 
hell , you know how skinny is . says he's gonna shoot' em ... an I says , " skinny , you can't do that , " an' he says , " Well , then get Little Bill down here an' let's settle this " an' I says , " Bill's sleepin' , skinny , " an' ... 
Nope . 
well , Ned , you'll want to tell me an' Mister Beauchamp here all about them two villainous friends of yours , I guess . bring him in , boys , for I will be glad to know the names and the whereabouts of those other two murdering sonsofbitches . 
ha . he was building his fucking porch . 
&apos; course he's coming . 
little Bill ? he didn't say nothing . like I said , he was Buildin' his porch . have you seen that thing ? 
maybe he ain't so tough . 
little Bill come out of Kansas an' Texas , boys . he worked them tough towns . 
a wise policy . but if you did , I can assure you , the sight of royalty would cause you to dismiss all thoughts of bloodshed and stand ... in awe . whereas , a president ... I mean , why not shoot a president ? 
down the street and across . Greely's Beer Garden and Billiard parlor . just ask for Alice and say you want a game of billiards . 
don't matter . they burned the table in' 78 for firewood . 
I didn't think they'd really do it . 
that Kid ... he's just a ... boy . and that other one , Bill , being true to his wife ... 
he said ... 
we ain't got it . we ain't got no money . 
we was ... lyin' . 
rain's coming . 
no ? 
whippin' ain't a little thing , Alice . 
for what they done ? skinny gets some ponies an' that's ... ? 
like whores ? 
on account of they seen you was beatin' on their friend . 
innocent of what ? 
I'm not going out anymore . I'm not getting hurt again . this was the last time . I told you . 
why ? 
where is it ? 
how long have you been married ? 
how did you get together ? 
... See my husband was a big football star in college and we were in an accident together . our car flipped on an icy road . we were both injured . he couldn't play football anymore . if that hadn't happened , we wouldn't have been together . 
football wasn't the kind of life I wanted ... For ten years I'd be by the phone waiting for a call telling me he broke his neck in a practice game . and if it wasn't that call , it would be a call telling me he blew out his knee or suffered his third concussion . I've seen way too much of it in my job ... I can barely take it when my clients are in pain . I don't hate the game . I admire the amount of skill it involved and , like everyone else , I was in awe of how he could play it , but I couldn't give him my heart and then have something happen to him . and it always does with that game . it's not a thing many people would understand . 
... And everyone lived happily ever after . 
I own a comic book museum . it's called the Limited edition . 
I believe comic books are based loosely on reality -- I believe there are real life equivalents of the heroes in those books that walk the earth -- I believe your husband is one of those individuals . 
okay . 
fine . 
against a window . 
was your family traveling with you ? 
did you get up from your seat ? 
what a coincidence ? I'm a male synchronized swimmer and I'm looking for representation . 
but I'm afraid of water , so that's been holding my career back a little bit . 
I'm meeting a player from Temple University . he's a cornerback . you like football ? 
this kid is six foot two , two hundred and forty pounds . he runs the fifty in under six seconds . he's going to be a God . 
is David Dunne there ? 
that's what I said to my son . he said , there's always two kinds . the soldier villain who fights the hero with his hands , and then there's the real threat . the brilliant and evil arch enemy who fights the hero with his mind . 
I want to sleep here tonight . 
I won't make any noise . 
in under six seconds . I've heard . 
just play one set of downs . I told them you were great . 
just one-- 
what things ? 
I'll help you . 
no . 
what if you only ate foods that were good for you and you worked out everyday for a year ? 
how much can you lift ? 
no Jeremy . 
I lied . 
two hundred and seventy . 
get mom . 
all of it . 
I'm sleeping in my room . 
that's great . 
you're secret identity . that man was right . 
Elijah was wrong . 
you're lying . 
Jeremy listen to what-- 
Jeremy if you pull that trigger I'm going to leave ! I'm going to go to New York . 
what's he look like ? 
send him packing . I'm not walking all the way over there . 
there's a message for you at the office . your kid was hurt . 
just now . they want you to come down to his school . 
it's a pleasure to meet you . I'm David Dunne . 
we are . 
I'm very proud of him . he's been through a lot in his life . a lot of ups and downs , a lot of bad spells . a couple I'd thought had broken him ... I mean emotionally . they were bad ... But he made it . yes he did . 
yes he is . 
I don't know for sure . ... I don't think so . 
seventy-five percent . 
skeptical about what ? 
in college . a car accident . 
you assumed wrong . 
the life of an idea that has lived too long in my head . 
what was your idea Elijah ? 
technically no . I gambled that you would attend the church service . I just waited for you . 
you've misunderstood . 
I've come to understand that ... An ill advised purchase in the parking lot . 
not money . but I appreciate your healthy cynicism in the manner . it will be wise for both of us to proceed with greatest caution . 
we've already begun . 
are you for real ? 
is there a problem ? 
how did you know that man you bumped was carrying a weapon ? 
you thought he was carrying a knife ? 
but not a knife ? 
you have good instincts when it comes to things like that ? 
telling when people have done something wrong ? 
have you ever tried to develop it ? 
you're skill . 
characters in comic books are often attributed special powers . x-ray vision , things of that sort . 
it's an exaggeration of the truth . maybe it's based on something as simple as instinct . like being able to touch someone and tell whether they've done something wrong ... Or the level of what they've done wrong . 
or he might have been carrying a silver handled gun tucked in his pants . 
one last question . 
the car accident you were in ... Was there anyone else involved ? 
that's not what I witnessed David . 
I never said you couldn't be killed . I never said that . 
are you finished ? 
I don't want to drag this out too long for Jeremy . 
he's asleep . 
I haven't been sick this year . I know that . 
do you remember me getting sick ? 
Megan , do you ever remember me getting sick ? 
that's strange isn't it ? not remembering one fever ... Or a cold ... Or a sore throat . what do you think that means ? 
yes . 
no that's it . 
the Mitchell barbecue three years ago . 
matching shirt and shorts . it was brutal . 
oh . 
yes . is this David ? 
my name is Megan Inverso . we went to college together . 
not often , but it is possible . most people get scared when they see the shadow of their limits . they don't know how long the shadow really is . they don't know how far away the real limits are standing ... They stop out of fear . 
you use your sleeve . 
he's dealing with a lot of things . I think he needs to find answers himself . 
yes . 
Jesus . 
rust ? 
I didn't know that . mine's still brown . 
what was that ? 
soft and wet . that's very interesting . 
think carefully ? 
that counts . 
I don't know Megan . 
you've made a considerably wise decision . 
my son Jeb . it's a gift for him . 
four . 
I'll keep it in my office room . 
I have a lock on the door . 
is Noel in ? 
oh . 
I had to put him down . 
ask if he can check how many sick days I've taken since I've worked here ? 
yes . 
Vat ? I am going 5 miles an hour ! I am looking town . I not even moving . 
I am Russian , da ! I am also &lt; u &gt; rich &lt; / u &gt; Russian , da ? maybe we work something out , my friend Sheriff ? 
what fuckin grocery store , you fucking shithead idiot ! you call yourself a police ... 
I want my lawyer ! 
aw , Toby , we weren't doing nothing . we was just talking . 
stay out of this , Jenny . we got man's business to take care of . I ain't never taken no drugs , mister , and ... 
I said come on ! 
wrong number . 
I put up new drapes , Jake . 
you never said anything . about the drapes . 
you haven't even looked at them once . 
I picked them out for you , Jake . I thought you would like the colors . 
nothing , Jake . absolutely nothing . 
yes , yes , hit me ... beat me , please . 
you broke her heart ! you broke your Mama's heart . you stole me ! that's right . fuck it away . but it ain't ever goin' away , cause your Mama -- she's like a hungry ghost baby , she won't go away , she won't leave ya alone . 
you didn't hear something ? 
there's someone in the house . 
shhhh ! just like your Mama , always scared of things ... 
like you helped her , Jake ? 
morning Sheriff . got my drapes . 
well , he offered , and I just couldn't refuse . his car overheated . 
hell , no . that Wayne can't shoot when he's sober , much less drunk . he's lucky he didn't kill his own danged self . well , anyhow , you stay cool . nice meeting you , son . 
no baby , you got it wrong . 
you sound just like Jake ... I did see into the future , Virgil , but you weren't in it . go back to your family . they love you . 
... But I bet the story she &lt; u &gt; didn't &lt; / u &gt; tell you was the best story of all . how old crazy Jake &lt; u &gt; was really her Papa &lt; / u &gt; . and she &lt; u &gt; liked &lt; / u &gt; fucking Papa ! and now she's killed the sonufabitch ! just like she's gonna kill you ! 
what was that all about ?
