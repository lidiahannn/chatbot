Dr. Fronkonsteen -- look ! 
let me come with you , Doctor , please ! I don't want to stay up here alone . 
Ooh ! 
look , Doctor ! 
&apos; as the minuteness of the parts formed a great hindrance to my speed , I resolved to make the creature of a gigantic stature .' of course ! that would simplify everything . 
soon , all the electrical secrets of Heaven shall be mine . 
a god ? 
right here ? 
reputation . reputation ! 
I don't understand -- I followed the notes to the letter .

MMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMmmmmm . 
MMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMmmmmmmmmmmm ! 
MMMMMMMMMM ! MMMMMMMMMMMM ! 
MMMmmmmmm . 
Frederick Frankenstein ? 
are you putting me on ? 
and do you also say Fro dereck ? 
why isn't it Frodereck Fronkon steen ? 
I see . 
no , it's pronounced Aye gor . 
well , they were wrong then , weren't they ? 
yes , that's right . my grandfather and your grandfather used to pal around together . you and I should have a lot of laughs . 
this is Inga . they thought you might need an assistant temporarily . 
are these your bags ? 
incidentally -- I don't mean to embarrass you in any way , but I'm a rather brilliant surgeon . perhaps I can help you with that hump . 
there . 
why are you talking like that ? 
no . 
what wockers ? 
Wockers with the knockers ? ? ? 
down ! get down , you beasts ! 
Aye-gor ! 
what are you doing here ? 
but what you were doing ? 
did you hear that strange music ? 
did you hear that strange music ? ? 
it seems that way . you didn't hear any music at all ? 
you didn't hear ... nothing ! aren't there any lights in this place ? 
did you see anyone else down here ? 
what is this place ? 
it is ! this was my grandfather's private library . look at this ! 
taking the book along ? 
what a filthy job ! 
how ? 
I have a pretty good idea . 
yes . Dr. H. Delbruck . 
was he any good ? 
hmm ! 
that's not bad . 
I'm getting excited just thinking about it . what if he's not there ? 
oh ! may I call you' Master' ? 
it's always been one of my favorite names . 
yes ! it's all written down in the notes . tie off the kites and come down ! 
you'd better hurry -- I think it's going to rain . 
the ancient masters promised impossibilities and performed nothing . we shall penetrate into the recesses of nature . we shall ascend into the Heavens . we shall command the thunders of Heaven , mimic the earthquake and even mock the invisible world with its own shadows . 
yes ! when I give the word -- throw the first switch ! 
throw the second switch ! 
it's not enough . more ! more , do you hear me ? 
what ? 
you can't win' em all . 
cold ! cold and dead ! 
don't try to cheer me up that way . 
you'll be getting me sad next . 
I'm not that sort you know . I appreciate you feelings , but try to show them some other way . 
oh , do you like it ? I'm not partial to desserts , but this is excellent . 
to you ! you just made a' yummy' sound , so I thought you liked the dessert . 
but you did -- I just heard it . 
better not get too close , master . this guy could kill you . 
it's trying to talk. it wants us to take off the straps . 
original . 
Whew ! I'm glad that's over with . 
yes . 
what's the point of my setup ? it's not funny unless you repeat exactly what you said . 
repeat it anyway -- it's a wonderful cue . 
no , no ! that whole thing ! 
it seem to have stopped the big fellow in his tracks . 
yes , Master ! 
how's it going ? 
someone was playing this in the music room . 
all right -- where is she ? 
bring -- me -- the -- violin ! 
thanks ... for all your help . 
I'm a failure . 
what monster ? 
you don't understand , Master . the big fellow's broken in and kidnapped your fiancee . 
that sound good , boss . 
I like your style , master . how do we get him here ? 
is everything ready ? 
it's the only way . 
that's' Fronkonsteen .' 
my name is pronounced Fron kon steen . 
but aren't you the grandson of the famous Dr. Victor Frankenstein ? ... who performed such fascinating experiments in electricity and galvanism ? 
I prefer , by far , to be remembered for my own small contributions to science . now if we can proceed to your questions . 
Dr. Fronkonsteen ! 
isn't it true that Darwin preserved a piece of vermicelli in a glass case until , by some extraordinary means , it actually began to move with voluntary motion ? 
Vermicelli . 
but wasn't that the whole basis of your grandfathers work , sir ... ? the re-animation of component parts ? 
but aren't you the least bit curious about it , Doctor ? doesn't the secret of life hold any intrigue for you ? 
yes , but , sir ... if it could be accomplished , wouldn't that eliminate disease from the human frame and render man invulnerable to any but a violent death ? 
nineteen , sir . 
but look at what's been done with hearts and kidneys ! 
but , sir ... 
you have more chance of re-animating this knife than you have of mending a broken nervous system , 
Dr. Frankenstein ? 
oh , at least , sir . the land alone is worth a small fortune . 
do you have a hundred thousand of them , sir ? 
a week . ten days at most . 
well ... if you're sure that I could accomplish everything in a week ... I suppose I could manage it . 
break that old man's violin . 
all right then , I suppose I owe the family that much . you'll have everything ready for me when I arrive ? 
one week at the most ! ? 
well , thank you very much for all your trouble . 
Saturday night then ! I'll take the train to New York and fly from there . 
I hope you find this comfortable . this was Baron Victor's room . 
you'll fine the keys to all the rooms in my cas ... all the rooms in your castle on this ring . I'll leave it on the table here . 
you mean ... the laboratory ? ? 
there seem to be quite a few books . 
I see . and where is my grandfather's private library ? 
well , there was a public and a private library -- he said so in his will. these books are all very general -- any doctor might have them in his study . 
surely he kept his notes -- his private papers and records in some other place ? 
well ... we'll see . 
I don't think so . is my assistant taken care of ? 
this wire came while you were gone . your fiancee will be arriving any moment . 
darling ! ... you will be careful ! ? 
you have your tickets ? 
and your passport ? 
call me from New York before you leave ? ? 
promise ? ? 
oh , darling -- I'll count the hours that you're away . 
will you miss me ? 
mother's going to help me with the invitations . 
I hope you like large weddings . 
I've trimmed the list to only our very closest friends ... but it still comes to three thousand . 
does that mean you love me ? 
I will ! goodbye , darling ! 
goodbye , darling . 
darling ! 
surprised ? 
love me ? 
darling ! ? ! 
ready , darling ? 
what a strange fellow . 
why does he call you' master' ? 
no , of course not . I just meant ... 
poor Delbruck ! there must be some way to reach him -- to control that body . 
but there's a genius inside that body -- crying out for love and understanding and normal human relationships . I just have to find some way to re-establish his communications system . 
oh , Delbruck , Delbruck . was will dien tachlas von Dir ? 
I suppose you're right . 
is your room just down the hall ? ... in case I get frightened during the night ? 
I don't want to spoil anything -- I just want to top it all off . 
that's a tough choice . 
I suppose you're right . 
good night . 
darling ! 
surprised ? 
Miss me ? 
what in God's name are you doing ? 
what ? 
you're incorrigible ! ... Aren't you ? 
mmmmm ! 
did you see ? ... I put a special hamper in the bathroom just for your shirts. the other one is just for socks and poo-poo undies . 
still happy you married me ? 
love me oodles and oodles ? 
so this is what it's like to be completely happy ! 
Herr Falkstein ! did you inform Frederick Frankenstein of this assembly and all the particulars of the time and place ? 
but I received a cable only this morning , saying that he could not come . 
yes , sir , he was . but he said he was obligated to lecture at Johns Hopkins University . 
&apos; functional areas of the cerebrum in relation to the skull .' 
yes , sir . 
where did you get this cauliflower ? 
didn't you prepare it with the celery before my lecture ? 
are you trying to make me look like an idiot ? 
give him an extra dollar . 
yes , sir . 
Carlson ! 
bring me some surgical gauze , a little tape and some disinfectant . 
... No ! 
you have the wrong house . 
Dr. Frederick Fronkonsteen . 
no ! 
Victor Frankenstein . 
ugly , vicious rumous . 
I think we all need a good night's sleep . why don't we meet next week and thrash this thing out ? 
yes , my dear , he is . 
he is the fifth leading authority in his field . 
I'll never understand your regard for them , Charles . 
I am trying to save our kind , Charles . you should do the same . 
is that so ? 
you definition of definitive was always a bit extreme for me , Max . what is it like these days ? 
if I could make you understand . if you could just be made to see it the way I do . the way it's going to be . 
I'm going to change the world with or without you as a witness , Charles . and this one gets a front row seat . 
this checkmate goes to you . I didn't want to hurt anyone . but you leave me no choice . 
I wouldn't really have let you die , you know . I just needed ... 
doesn't it ever wake you in the middle of the night ? the feeling that some day , some day very soon , they will pass that foolish law - or one just like it - and they will come for you and your children ? take you all away ? 
and what do you do when you wake up to that ? 
I lost him . 
is that what you're looking for ? 
is it enough ? 
I'll find him . 
why is everybody up at sunrise ? 
what did she do to me ? 
I felt like she almost killed me . 
what am I doing here ? 
who ? 
forty-eight hours , old man . but if you cross me , I won't feel any guilt about what I do to you . 
the point of what ? 
the point is to step into a more evolved position of social responsibility . to recognize that there is a world out there and that we mutants are as much a part of it as normal human beings . 
now that's magneto talking . 
where are we going ? 
how ? 
you designed this yourself ? 
he helped you ? 
they're all asking how you're doing . are you feeling up to saying hello to everyone ? 
why ? you have a home here now , if you want it . everyone will ... 
I do love a good check mate . 
come with me and I'll let her live . 
where am I ? 
you ... wha ... Who are you ... Where is Henry ? 
the intention of registration act - 
what is it you intend to do to me ? 
you're avoiding the question I posed to you at the beginning of the hearing , Ms. Grey . three words : are mutants dangerous ? 
Ms. Grey -- you work at a school for mutants in Westchester , New York . can you tell the members of this committee what exactly you are teaching these mutants ? 
you wouldn't happen to be teaching them how to use their powers to -- 
this was taken by a state police officer in Secaucus , New Jersey . a man in a minor altercation literally melted the car in front of him . I don't know where you come from , Ms. Grey , but where I come from , you don't go melting people's cars when they cut you off . you do it the old fashioned way -- you give' em the finger . but what you presume to tell this committee - 
I'm sorry to come here , Ms. Grey . I was afraid if I went to a hospital , they would ... 
tell it to the ones that did this to me . 
some cigars . case of beer . 
I won't light the cigars - how about that ? 
what if I like the pain ? 
yeah ? well I don't like to talk about my past . 
by reading my thoughts ? 
you should always work with a spotter . 
were you now ? 
he takes his work seriously . 
Logan , do you see this ring ? 
inspiring -- Now what am I doing here ? 
how long have you been in Alaska ? 
I've served with men like you before . methodical . Systematic -- naive . you know what happens to those men in a real fight ? 
I'm o.k. I'm o.k. 
Scott .. I - 
what are you talking about ? 
what's wrong with him ? 
he's already losing control of his vitals . respiratory . cardiovascular . unless we manage to replace the filter by tomorrow morning , I'm afraid . 
are you all right ? 
hey . I'm sorry . about Logan . I was jealous . 
I'll tell you one thing though . 
radar Stealth mode checks out . all right , there'll be less security north of the George Washington Bridge . I'm taking her down . 
I'm going to assume that means that the Secret Service is out of commission . Jean , can you raise me up there ? 
I'm sorry . I'm not strong enough . 
correct ... Apparently , Adamantium is the only metal strong enough to hold the energy this machine produces . he used the Adamantium in Logan's dog tag to test it on the Senator . and I assume now he plans to use the rest of Logan's skeleton for a larger demonstration . 
yes -- Only there's a problem . the mutator gene is not responding to the radiation the way it would in mother nature . it's forcing the body's cells to replicate thousands of times faster than they're accustomed to . the Senator's body is literally burning itself out . Scott -- this machine kills people and I don't think magneto realizes it . 
what does that mean ? 
Thomas Edison knew how to make the light bulb . he had the energy source . he had the vacuum . but he didn't have the filament . he tried metal after metal but nothing would hold to power . 
I wish I could go . 
storm . try to look for the highest vantage point . from what I can figure , he'll need to gain as much altitude as possible to blanket the island . it is my feeling that magneto has to-- 
that's the guy . 
cops . like a plague . no matter how many you pay there's always another with his hand out . how did you pick him out ? 
I appreciate you bringing this to our attention . whatever you want , the rest of the night , consider it on the house . 
sorry , man , don't know what you're talking about . 
I remember that one where you jump the motorcycle over the freeway at rush hour . 
I'm somewhat less so . we seem to have a bit of a problem ... 
of course . 
what's going on , my friend ? 
he's not with us , Xander . he must be with you . 
total chaos , man ! welcome to anarchy 99 ! 
it's all this craziness ! it's what we've been living since 99 , when we left the Army . one of our brothers died in Grozny and we said the hell with this shit . what for ? he dies for what ? politics ? who's politics ? not ours . 
screw the world . if I'm gonna die for something , it better be bitches and money . 
" ... try walking into a deli and urinating on the cheese " .' anarchy Burger' by the Vandals . 
how you gonna do that with government and rules everywhere ? 
you got a great set-up here Yorgi . you really know how to live . 
I've been here before , when I was a kid . my old man was in the service , we used to live on the Army base in Hamburg . 
hell no . my dad was a straight up tin soldier . somehow he pissed this general off and got himself dishonorably discharged . had a court martial and everything . the charges were total bullshit , so he was sure he'd get his name cleared , but it didn't happen . 
I've got meetings this afternoon , I've got to get some sleep . just pick a girl . 
and you . why do you have such a problem staying away , my friend ? did you miss us that much ? 
what's the gimmick , Yorgi ? that's the part I don't get . you gonna hold the world hostage with your gas bombs ? I didn't think you were dumb enough to go with that hack cliche . 
so all by yourself , you're going to destroy every government ; in the world . 
including rape , pillage , murder . 
and here I thought " anarchy " was just something cool to put on a Tshirt . 
you both could have been a part of it . you could have ridden with us into a new day , the dawning of a new age of -- 
what's so damn funny ? 
who's writing this dude's dialogue ? 
help me with this guy . 
they're all over the place ! what the hell's going on ? 
sit down . 
my name is Slovo , Czech secret police . when you are here you are under my jurisdiction , you take my orders , you do what I say . if you become any kind of an inconvenience , I'll shoot you . 
nice hops . 
Dude , what are you doing here ? 
I found something big enough for us to take these guys down with . they've got a of nerve agent they're gonna unleash . 
sorry , " dude " . 
why you dogging me up ? 
hey , you don't need all this just to go on vacation . unless this ain't for going on vacation ... 
I can see that . why ? 
I'm having fun , what's the problem ? 
French Polynesia ? this wouldn't last us a week in a cheap hotel . do you know how expensive it is down there ? 
it's not about the money , X ! you never plan for anything . I can't live like that anymore , I need some stability . 
what ... ? 
you're serious ? 
this is so typical . I can't believe you . I've barely seen you for the last three weeks and now this ? are you out of your mind ? 
you can't just propose to me out of nowhere . you think that's going to solve our problems ? I'm sorry , X. It was a kick for a while , but it's over . you're just not going anywhere . 
hate those Russkie choppers . Rattle- trap pieces of garbage . I'm agent Shavers . Toby Lee Shavers . I'm looking for what's his name . three X' s . 
back off , just go away you Klutz . alright , here's the story . the items in these cases belong to me . I designed them , built them , and was going to use them in the field myself until you showed up . 
is that supposed to be funny ? I'm not laughing . I've worked for ten years to get my shot at being a field agent , funny boy . and ar the last minute I get bumped by you , some reject from the Ozzfest . 
miniature power cams set in on contact , giving you a sure grip on any surface . 
this is your standard dart gun . 
I think I'll hang on to these . 
from the Beastie Boys collection ? 
you're joking , right ? 
nothing . he had two days . 
what are you doing ? 
what was that for ? 
you've been so quiet lately , Petra , I thought you no longer cared . 
Viktor ! stay the course . 
ten is hardly worth the effort . we're talking a lousy million five U.S. 
do you know what a wire transfer is ? 
my goodness , a word with four syllables . I should get some ice before your brain gets too hot . 
if you got a problem with me , why are we dancing ? 
you do everything Yorgi says ? 
it's gonna be like that , huh ? you got all bent out of shape as soon as he started dancing with someone else . why's that ? 
why are you still hanging around ? your business is finished , you should go home . 
I don't know who you are or where you come from , but I don't like you . you ask too many questions . 
don't even bother , X man , I'm not your type . 
who are you ? 
I also remember you drove your car here . who are you really ? make no mistake , I will shoot you and not feel bad about it . who are you working for ? 
bullshit . I see you look at everything , study everything , ask questions . I know exactly what you're doing . empty your pockets . 
hey , you're good . 
I don't know what you're talking about . 
go to hell ! 
what are you ? 
that's how you eat ? it's like a gerbil . 
so why don't you tell me something about who you gather information for . they obviously have very deep pockets . are you from a rival clan ? 
whoever sent you knew what they were doing . you and Yorgi are practically twins . two nihilistic fashion victims who make a lot of noise but don't say much . 
I know where he's coming from . the only thing I really don't get is why he dumped you . up until I found that out , I thought his judgment was pretty sound . 
the people I know want facts , the kinds of things an insider would know . they're interested in putting anarchy 99 out of business . 
we could work together . then maybe we could both get the hell out of here . there's a beach in Bora Bora with my name on it . 
they tell me you're an American agent . 
there's no more time for games . they made you . there's a sniper out front waiting to put a bullet in your eye . tell me if it's true . 
Jesus Christ . you're going to have to go out the back . the data that you copied with your toy . tomorrow , at six o'clock . look it up . we're taking a trip . be there at six and you'll have plenty to tell your people . 
that's alright , I'll figure something out . 
I can't let this happen . I want you to go out the back . I'll make up some excuse . 
so what's the plan with this Ahab ? are they selling it or what ? 
we've got to find out what it is . can you handle that ? 
what's that ? 
you're what ? what the hell have you been doing ? 
I'm busted up for you , but Jesus , what the hell are you doing ? those people almost drowned on that boat and you didn't lift a finger . 
get your head back in the game . there are lives at stake here . 
when can I see you again ? 
are you alright ? 
I heard you talking . I could tell where you were in the room . 
what are you doing with the Ivans ? 
we're getting out of this place . we've done enough . 
it doesn't matter anymore , forget it . 
what do we owe our governments ? yours kidnapped you , mine abandoned me . 
no , now it's about us . let's do something for us before we both get killed . don't you want to get to Bora Bora , Xander ? 
they left . to a fortress in the mountains . 
aren't you afraid ? 
I must be healthy , then , because I'm scared to death . I guess I'd better get back to Yorgi . 
yes , I do . you're right . I can't just let him go free . besides , I can help you from the inside . 
I was supposed to wait for the cop to kill you and then kill the cop . they'll believe me . I've been lying for so long , one more time won't hurt . 
he's a regular humanitarian . and all this time I thought he was just a tool . 
did you do your homework ? 
where'd the damn truck go ? ! 
Toadies right behind . 
you okay ? 
he's shut out the communication circuit ! 
no , it's like a safety . we are going to have to access the manual controls . 
it's running three meters down . twenty knots . 
by then it's too late ! the only way to safely dispose of the nerve agent is in deep water ! the chemicals will break down and dissipate ! 
I can't believe my mission is finally over . I don't even know what to do with myself . 
what are you doing ? 
what game is that ? 
do they have any special powers ? the bosses always have special powers . 
next we got a Siberian redneck , Viktor . into snowmobiles and snowboarding . so naturally , he covers prostitution and the drug trade . 
this guy's kinda dorky lookin' . 
Yorgi masterminded the take-over of three Red Mafiya clans . cops called it " blood week " . he combined all of their global enterprises into one huge crime syndicate : anarchy 99 . 
what are you gonna do ? they're Euro- trash . 
just about anything I want , it looks like . this is gonna be tough , though . there's no way to save this game . I gotta get it right the first time through . 
nothing , really . my guy is just doing it to stay alive . 
like what ? 
Whatchu doing here ? 
we're on to the game , ese . you got the fake blood splattered all over the walls , you got your torture tools ... It's all very cute . but come on , let's quit while you're ahead . I'm only trying to save you a beatin' . 
alright . you wanna eat through a tube , be my guest . 
what do you have ? 
he was the best there was . that makes three agents lost . 
silent Night in the hands of a bunch of impertinent cowboys 
how will you fix it ? 
so you'll dredge the bottom again . you've done that before . the results were ... uneven . 
the usual prospects . convicts , contract killers , murde ... 
but programmable . and expendable . 
they're degenerates . there's not a man in there that would give a damn if the Chinese took over . 
ridiculous . cut him off . I'm sorry Gibbons , you pulled up a shark this time . 
you what ? a wire transfer of this size ? 
you're talking about a very expensive risk here . 
the name's Gibbons . you were saying ? 
looks like a diner . 
most guys we ran through this either took off or helped them rob the place . I expected you to do the same . 
whether you thought this was for real or not , you jumped in and helped the waitress on instinct . that tells me something about your character . 
it's your lucky day . you just might get the chance to pay back our wonderful country for all the freedom you enjoy . 
alright , cage , you've got me . this is one of those moments . " many are called , few are chosen " , that kind of thing . your government needs you . are you up for the challenge ? 
why is that ? 
oh I don't know , I think the tests work pretty well . sometimes they give me answers you wouldn't admit to in a million years . 
you've got this wrong . you're not under arrest , you've been abducted . and until I say different , you belong to me . 
sure as gravity . I've had a feeling about you from the start , cage . it's nausea . 
congratulations , you've just graduated at the head of your class . 
you want the cheap backstory ? the runaway mom , the suicide dad and the foster homes ? gimme a break . you're not interested in my past , you're interested in my future as some kind of spy . 
I'm not interested . I've already got a job . 
I plan on getting a lot older . and playing spy games sounds like a quick way to get yourself dead . 
now I'm the one who's nauseous . so what's the deal ? what do you need me for ? 
what do I get out of it ? 
how about a pedicure as long as you're down there . what's this ? Lo-Jack ? 
I expect you to call in regularly with progress reports . 
up yours . 
is that all ? 
I guess you got my E-mail . I set up a purchase . ten cars . 
buddy , you sent me here to get close to their organization , that costs money . 
we're not after car thieves here . 
that information is classified . you're there to gather information on their operations , period . 
my friend , if you're planning on crossing me ... 
you did say " Ahab " ? you're sure about that ? 
this is good work , X , damn fine work . you need to press on at all costs , find out what they have planned with this " Ahab " . 
thanks . 
snow covered fortress . army of bad guys . the usual . 
yes it does . 
silent Night is the name of a top secret binary nerve agent . the glass canister is shot into the air and detonated . the black and white chemicals mix , forming a toxic cloud . when it settles down to Earth , it'll kill everything in the vicinity . 
yeah , that's right . so now that you know , you understand why it's important that we get it back . 
somebody else makes those decisions , not guys like you and me . you've done your job , X , head back to Prague . I'll be landing in 90 minutes . this is my operation now . 
thought you bought the farm down there , X. Glad as hell to see you . 
you've kept up your end of the bargain , I'll do the same . but you really should consider staying on , you make a decent agent . 
cut the crap , X , I saw you down there . you're a hero . don't be afraid to join the good guys . 
you know what they say , the only way to change the system is from the inside . 
on come on , X. Did you really think we were that barbaric ? 
all for show . just a psychological mind game to get you to do the right thing . 
new information . 
too important for telephone . comedian -- Dr. Manhattan . all linked up . 
yeah , I've heard all about your conspiracy theories . now I've got a roomful of cameras in there . I want you out . now . and whatever you're doing , knock it off . you're making us all look bad . 
Gila Flats -- place where Jon turned into . . . 
Veidt . you're the one who started World War III . 
call off the cat and I'll kill you , Veidt . 
I don't know who you are buddy , but I swear to God , you got the wrong guy . 
you're making a big -- 
Rorschach , you're talkin' heavy duty stuff . I got nothing to do with -- 
CTU ? Jesus . you don't think -- 
two things I hate . street mimes . . . Users of recreational drugs . 
Adrian . 
don't rub it in . I live here . 
Adrian ! don't leave so soon . I -- 
please . 
stay , Adrian . I just -- every once in a while , I need to talk to someone human . he doesn't think like we do . he doesn't even feel what we feel . I mean -- he even scares the research teams . 
I know . I shouldn't be saying this . he's happy , he's content , he's doing his work -- 
I suppose I'm serving my purpose , aren't I. I'll ring for the guards . 
maybe I'll do that . 
their real names , please . 
I don't know their real names ! 
then why don't you ask him ? ! ? 
what are you saying ? that Jon is radioactive ? 
what does this mean ? what does it -- 
all right , Miss Juspeczyk . pack your things . 
you're free to do whatever you goddamn well please . let's move it . 
oh , I am , honey . you see , Russian tanks are crossing the Afghan border this very minute . and we are all of us , every living soul , in deep , deep shit -- because our number-one strategic weapons has finally flipped out . 
that's right . your meal ticket's flown the coop . that blue bastard has apparently left the planet . 
no . no . cut . -- Justine , we agreed . no questions about the Watchmen . 
no comment . 
I did not . now get out of my way ! 
with lots of ketchup ? 
Jon Osterman , you don't act like a Princeton boy . what's a big lug like you doing in a place like this ? 
we should get back -- What ? 
stupid watch . stopped again . do you have the -- 
I can fix it . 
Hiya , pardner . long time no see . 
sure . you got some kind of -- bean juice on it . 
so do I. So do you . 
maybe . or maybe somebody's finally caught up with us . somebody with a grudge . thought you might want to spread the word . 
. . . that was quick . 
I don't know if you heard . a hired gunman tried to off Adrian . 
what new information ? 
what do you mean , frame-up ? 
are you saying that someone would risk starting World War III just to get back at us ? what about all those poor shits with cancer ? 
come on , Rorschach . gimme a break -- 
we're running , Rorschach . we've got no place to go . we're hightailing it down to Adrian's . 
cases , leads -- they don't matter , Rorschach . the world's about to end . if someone is trying to kill us , it doesn't matter . 
shut UP , Rorschach . 
what happened ? 
what caused it ? 
Adrian . what are you doing ? why wouldn't you let us in ? 
Adrian -- you ? you killed Blake , and -- 
sorry , it's this thing with Blake . I mean , you don't really think anyone's out to get us -- do you ? 
psychotic pig . he had it coming . Mr. CTU . . . 
okay , okay . you made your choice . you went underground . some of us made other choices . 
damn straight . 
of course , we looked like idiots in those bondage outfits . 
oh yeah . the one that used to confess to everything ? hoping we'd beat him up ? 
oh , yeah . they gave me a clean bill of health and then booted me the hell out . no expense account . no place to live . 
they're not following me , Dan . I mean -- Jon's gone , we're right on the brink of World War III . nobody cares about the Watchmen . 
oh . no . sorry . I'll be right down the hall if you want me . . . I mean , if you need some aspirin , or -- 
his what ? 
I told you I was a little bit out of step . a lot of the old stuff I listen to -- it never came out on crystal . 
no wonder Adrian's rich . you use that stuff ? 
I don't mind getting older . I'm obsolete anyway . why try to hide it ? 
old ? 
. . . what ? 
eight cops ? oh , great . a jury's gonna love that . 
I just realized . I'd never seen his face . I guess it was just a matter of time . he's totally -- Daniel ? what's wrong ? 
Ohh . I could use some dinner . who was that on the phone ? 
-- What is it . 
Laurie -- 
enough is enough , Daniel . where exactly are we ? 
the Owlship . I can't believe it . 
I took her out a couple of summers back . scared the hell out of some cows . -- I wonder if she'd make it down to Antarctica . 
would you want to sit out a war ? I mean -- what would be left . 
Dan ! the spare costumes ! I can't believe you kept them . 
God , you sound like Jon . -- Turn around . 
don't look . turn around . 
okay ! 
it's a peace rally . the CTU's just opened fire on the crowd . 
they're following us . 
missed' em Dan . you're aiming high ! 
they're practically on us . . . 
what ? 
no way . I'm not that much of a pervert . 
no offense , Laurie , but it was Silk Spectre I had the crush on . tonight was the first time I've felt like myself in ten years . 
it's because there's nothing to be afraid of anymore . the world's about to end . I feel like I could save it . 
long as we're on the subject of perverts . . . I miss Rorschach . let's spring him . 
what's he doing ? 
I beg your pardon . . . ? some gratitude . 
welcome back , Night Owl . 
what was he doing ? 
he saved himself . he changed the past . 
those cars . what year is this ? ? 
Dan -- what do we do now ? 
the comedian . he's dead . murdered . that's all I know . 
it's -- he's got some kind of conspiracy theory . he thinks someone's . . . I don't know , stalking us . 
I know , I know , it's just -- he's back on the street , he smells blood . 
if he comes here , I'll handle him . remember -- I've always protected you . haven't I ? do you need money ? 
you did the right thing , Daniel . let's stay in touch , okay ? good night . 
I don't know , but . . . in the wake of all that's happened , I'm starting to think Rorschach may have been right . is Laurie okay ? 
good . be careful , Daniel , don't let up your guard . look , I'm going to head south for a while -- hole up at Karnak until all this blows over . you two would be welcome to join me . 
the missing scientists . 
what ? ? 
it is Jon . twenty-four years ago . before he turned into Dr. Manhattan . 
gentlemen , the past . unfolding before your eyes . stand back from the field . it'll blow you to bits . 
it's a tachyon chamber . it generates subatomic particles which flow backward in time . there are other worlds , Daniel , other timelines -- existing parallel to our own -- 
and what if you ¹ re wrong ? 
what if you ¹ re wrong ? ? 
your problem , Dan , is a lack of vision . you spent all those years chasing after muggers , and drug dealers , and jaywalkers . . . as if the world was any better for it . as if any of it mattered . 
Blake ? dead ? 
I'm here , Laurie . 
would you like me to stay ? 
I could stay and go . 
I'm not here . I'm still on Mars . I've come to collect you . 
Jon , no -- I can't -- 
the atmosphere . I'm sorry . these things slip my mind . 
this whole place is ticking . does it -- keep time ? 
Jon , does anybody know what the hell you're talking about ? Dan's just an ordinary guy , but he talks to me . when he looks at me he's seeing something more than just a -- a collection of atoms . 
well , I just , you just said -- don't act surprised . 
yes , I loved you . I left the earth when I lost you . 
I didn't give you cancer , Laurie . not you , not the others . I don't know what did . 
memories of the future are just like any others . I've tried not to dwell on the unpleasant ones . . . you won't die of cancer , Laurie . there won't be time for that . 
always . ever since the day I died . 
because -- 
I don't know yet . I should be able to tell you in -- roughly six hundred years . 
please , Laurie . not yet . I've got eons stretching before me , a universe to explore . I'll be alone . you're the last human being I'll ever see . 
I'm sorry . look -- there's a gas storm on the Valles Marineris . . . 
you're the only human being I care for . 
I won't do that . 
I explained this . I can't . that's not the way it happens . 
what -- am I -- 
it ¹ s very strange . time ¹ s flowing backwards . . . 
Jon , where are we ? 
Jon -- 
Jon -- for God ¹ s sake , what do you see ? 
hi , Jon . 
the bearer of bad news . 
Rorschach's on the case . he's got Dreiberg in a lather . he seems to think that someone is " stalking " the Watchmen . 
what's your theory ? 
I guess you'll be dismantling Russian tanks soon . 
what ARE YOU DOING , VEIDT ? 
Walter -- 
Walter -- you're just telling me what you think I want to hear . 
there's no right or wrong . but if you don't give me an honest response , I can't help you . I want to help you . I want to know all about you . 
a whore fucking . 
and what -- split -- the dog's skull open ? 
Walter . this compulsion of yours -- to punish transgressors . in your mind . . . what gives you the right to judge ? 
that man , then , he was the first . the first you -- 
had a lot of blood in him . 
small army , from the looks of it . he put up one hell of a fight . 
Washington ? 
what about our end ? 
what kind of time frame are we talking about ? 
as you can see , we may be able to salvage a good-sized chunk of the farm belt . 
we don't really know , sir , but bluntly , our survival capability . . . may depend on a quirk of the weather . 
Major Adamson , I can't seem to get in the door . 
why ? what's the problem ? 
I would like to use the bathroom -- 
what ? ! 
we ’ ve been pawns in someone ’ s game . they tricked us into bringing the money to King . not just elaborate . Cock-sure . 
do we have the range of Renard ’ s plane ? 
it ’ s heading for the oil terminal . 
any word from him ? 
warm . 
so beautiful . so smooth , so warm . 
why are you like this ? because Bond is dead ? it ’ s what you wanted . 
he was a ... good lover ? 
this is the end . 
everything ’ s under control up here . are you ready ? 
perhaps this isn ’ t the time ... 
your father ... 
now you know how it feels . to be locked away , to wonder if they ’ re coming for you , if anyone will ever come for you . 
what ? 
no ! bond ! 
what is this place ? 
in the good old days , the KGB had three or four spots where our submarines could surface without anyone knowing . but Yevgeny is supposed to be loading cargo . 
Valentin Zukovsky . 
you , of course . I need some information . 
Mafia warlords , Diplomats and spies , consortiums from every country in the world . a nice little rat ’ s nest . 
see ? you ’ re upsetting my customers . what do you want ? 
what ? this is not possible . 
where did you get this ? 
that too . everyone does what they can to survive . 
bond . if someone wants you dead , it is Renard . our government has nothing to gain by killing you . 
she ’ s no innocent . this is my nuclear consultant . 
really Bond , couldn ’ t you find a nice Russian scientist with hair growing out of his ears ? 
I thought you were the one in her business . 
now ... where were we ? 
alright , alright ! sometimes I smuggle machinery for her . Russian stuff . 
where ’ s the sub going ? ! 
this is too big for even you . where is it ? 
so . my way . no MI-6 , no Interpol . just you , me and my people . 
mother of God . 
how appropriate . 
I met you at my father ’ s funeral . 
funerals aren ’ t exactly memorable . 
is that why you want to finish the pipeline ? 
who is he ? 
how long has he been with you ? 
does this look familiar to you ? 
are you trying to break my heart ? or is it just your way with women ? 
if you ’ ve come here to look after me , Mr. Bond , thank you , but no thank you . I have two bodyguards , I don ’ t need a third ... 
that ’ s every man within a five mile radius . including you . that ’ s why you ’ re here , isn ’ t it ? you think I can ’ t do it . you think I ’ m going to screw up . or get myself killed . 
I have to check the upper lines . Gabor will drive you back . 
you don ’ t take no for an answer , do you ? 
oh my God ... we ’ re buried alive ... 
I can ’ t stay here . 
no ! it will cave in ! 
I can ’ t stay . 
the way I acted , in the snow ... you must think I ’ m a coward . 
what is it ? 
I have to go . 
no . you ’ ll be safe here . 
vodka martini . 
what the hell are you doing here ? 
if this little show is for my benefit , I ’ ll take you home right now . 
I understand it ’ s normally good practice to get the feel of the cards before going off the deep end . 
surely you believe in living dangerously . 
you knew when you first saw me . you knew it would be like this . 
how did you survive ? 
what ’ s wrong with you ? are you crazy ? 
what are you talking about ? 
... what ? 
are you saying ... Renard is the man who ’ s trying to kill me ? 
I don ’ t know what you ’ re talking about ! 
how dare you ! how dare you ! that animal ! ? that monster ! ? he disgusts me ! you disgust me ! so he knew where to hurt you , is that it ? you had a sling on your arm at the funeral ! I didn ’ t have to sleep with you to find that out . 
I ’ m coming with you . 
I could have given you the world . 
where ’ s M ? 
all this , because you fell for Renard ? 
since I was a child , I ’ ve always had a power over men . when I realized my father wouldn ’ t rescue me from the kidnappers , I knew I had to form a new alliance . 
so you killed your father . 
was this all about the oil ? 
it runs in my veins , thicker than blood . I ’ m going to redraw the map . and when I am through the whole world will know my name , my grandfather ’ s name , the glory of my people . 
one ... last ... screw ? 
beautiful , isn ’ t it ? 
today , of all days , the sun decides to shine . 
a word ? I ’ m sure by now he ’ s engineered a hostile takeover . 
he was my father . 
I see my friend Davidov ran into some difficulty . 
revenge isn ’ t so hard to fathom . what ’ s clever is getting someone else to pay for it . 
who is it ? 
you will never touch her . you will never get near her . 
consider me ungrateful . 
she ’ ll get over it . 
in case you ’ ve forgotten . I ’ m dead already . 
not the usual Swiss procedure , Mr. Bond , but you understand , a man in my position .. 
I did not get the report from an MI-6 agent . 
I am just a middle man . I am doing the honourable thing and returning the money to its rightful owner ... 
your last chance . take the money . 
the name ? 
construction ’ s not exactly my line . 
old friend ? 
she ’ s not a girl anymore . 
it ’ s barely a scratch . the Dome broke my fall . 
007 . what do you know of the Caspian Sea ? 
who told you to look at Elektra ’ s files ? 
I was the one who brought that money in ... 
it ’ s a message . he wants us to know he ’ s back . 
Claude Serrault . A.K.A ... 
sir Robert tried to deal with the kidnapping with his own ... resources , at first . when Elektra ’ s ear was delivered to him in the post , he came to me . I advised against paying the ransom . I knew it was Renard . I played it out as long as possible to get a fix on him . 
he survived ? 
the bullet is moving through the medulla oblongata , killing off his sense of touch . he feels no pain . he can push himself harder , longer than any normal man . 
now Robert is dead . he got his revenge . 
get out to the pipeline . find the insider who switched the pin . if your instincts are right , Renard will be back . he hasn ’ t completed the job . the pipeline is still going forward , and we have Elektra to thank for that . 
the report King bought . it ’ s a manual . Renard ’ s men used it to remove this radio tracking device from the warhead . 
the inside man ? 
dislocated collar bone . if any more tendons snap ... It won ’ t just be two weeks out of action . 
it ’ s just a scratch . 
then maybe I ’ d be ... open to that . 
... yes ? ... 
you new ? 
doctor . Jones . Christmas Jones . no jokes , I ’ ve heard them all . 
what happened to Len Tashka ? 
he is an impostor . there ’ s no Davidov at Miratom . 
shame you had to spot I wasn ’ t the real thing . 
when this is over we should bury the hatchet . celebrate . a champagne dinner ? 
the plutonium is missing . they ’ ve taken the core ! 
what the hell were you doing ? you nearly killed us ! 
what the hell are you talking about ? 
who ’ s she ? 
Elektra King ? are you insane ? this is her pipeline . 
what would she want with weapons grade plutonium ? 
what is it ? 
nuclear . 
but why ? eight million people would die , the land irradiated for a hundred years . a cloud of radiation the size of Europe ... 
the King pipeline . 
Zukovsky ... 
is there another way ? 
he ’ s sealed himself in . 
do you know what you ’ re doing ? 
what kind of bikes did you ride ? 
count to twenty . when you get to twenty open the hatch . it can only be opened for a few seconds or we ’ ll sink . 
I love Christmas in Turkey . 
as for you , my galvanized friend , you want a heart ! you don't know how lucky you are not to have one . hearts will never be practical until they can be made unbreakable . I could have been a world figure , a power among men , a - a successful wizard , had I not been obstructed by a heart . 
stop that dog ! 
oh ! help me ! the balloon's going up ! 
help ! 
it makes you nervous ? 
what about us ? 
what about the heart that you promised Tin Man -- ? 
-- And the courage that you promised cowardly Lion ? 
well -- 
therefore , by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Universitatus Committeeatum e plurbis unum , I hereby confer upon you the honorary degree of Th.D. 
how can I ever thank you enough ? 
beautiful ! what an echo ! 
I'm not afraid of her . I'll see you get safely to the Wizard now , whether I get a brain or not ! stuff a mattress with me ! hah ! 
no , sir ! 
that's right . 
to Oz ? 
animals that -- that eat straw ? 
I'd be gentle as a lizard -- 
then I'm sure to get a brain -- 
come on -- come on -- 
oh ! oh , come on , come on ! 
hey , Dorothy ! 
oh - oh , poor Dorothy ! 
oh ! we ought to try and carry Dorothy . 
let's . 
oh -- now look at him ! this is terrible ! 
oh , this is terrible -- can't budge her an inch ! this is a spell , this is ! 
did you hear that ? he'll announce us at once ! I've as good as got my brain ! 
oh , did - did you see that ? 
it's a whozis . 
help ! help ! help ! help ! help ! 
they tore my legs off , and they threw them over there ! then they took my chest out , and they threw it over there ! 
who do you suppose they were ? and where did they take her ? a fine thing - to go to pieces at a time like this ! 
oh , dear , dear . 
... to Dorothy ! 
oh , I hate to think of her in there . we've got to get her out . 
no , you don't . 
Whew ! that wasn't my plan - but something happened , didn't it ? 
yeah -- 
oh - upstairs , quickly ! 
hey -- what about Dorothy ? 
... junk ! 
quiet ! 
... of the West . 
Mr. Gale ! 
... about Dorothy . 
what's she done ? I'm all but lame from the bite on my leg ! 
no , her dog ! 
sneaking up on me , eh ? why ! 
I haven't slept in weeks . 
not even a rhinoceros ? 
from now on , we're on enemy ground . you should have something to protect yourself with . 
what's that ? what's that ? take it away - take it away - Take it away ! 
it's a whatzis ? 
now , let' s see -- this goes -- Oh , I wish I were better at puzzles . 
there . now , that's the best we can do without any pins . 
... I -- I -- I hope my strength holds out . 
no ? now , wait a minute . 
where do we go now ? 
you don't get around us that easy ! 
comin' to think of it , forty winks wouldn't be bad . 
what if it were a brontosaurus ? 
would ... would it do any good if I roared ? 
wait a minute , fellahs . I was just thinkin' . I really don't want to see the Wizard this much . I better wait for you outside . 
what happened ? 
oh , you did it yourself ! 
here -- Come on . 
they sure knocked the stuffings out of you , didn't they ? 
I've got a plan how to get in there . 
and you're going to lead us . 
yes , you . 
up ! 
do -- do you think it'll be polite -- dropping in like this ? 
where -- where do we go now ? 
you humbug ! 
real courage . that's what we want . 
yeah . 
Dorothy next ! 
... excellence to the Miracle Wonderland Carnival Company -- until one day , while performing spectacular feats of stratospheric skill never before attempted by civilized man , an unfortunate phenomena occurred . the balloon failed to return to the fair . 
who killed my sister ? who killed the Witch of the East ? was it you ? answer me ! 
... ting the Ruby slippers ? 
the Ruby slippers ! what have you done with them ? give them back to me , or I'll --- 
you stay out of this , Glinda , or I'll fix you as well ! 
... don't talk . 
down ? no , you see , I'm -- Well , -- I'm -- 
... yes . 
Ohh ! 
oh -- does it hurt you ? 
Ohhh -- 
... free ! 
did I scare you ? 
wonderful ! why , if our Scarecrow back in Kansas could do that , the crows'd be scared to pieces ! 
where's Kansas ? 
you're going to see a Wizard ? 
do you think if I went with you this Wizard would give me some brains ? 
yes -- that's true . 
witch ? huh ! I'm not afraid of a witch ! I'm not afraid of anything --- except a lighted match . 
Hooray ! we're off to see a Wizard ! 
oh , I'll try ! really , I will . 
oh , dear -- I keep forgetting I'm not in Kansas . 
Hooray ! I guess that did it ! help yourself . 
why , it's a man ! a man made out of tin ! 
oil can what ? 
he said his mouth . 
... just that the Witch is so wicked . I don't think you two ought to come with me because you'll get into trouble . 
oh , you're the best friends anybody ever had ! and it's funny , but I feel as if I've known you all the time . but I couldn't have , could I ? 
I don't like this forest ! it's -- it's dark and creepy ! 
oh , that's too bad . don't you think the Wizard could help him , too ? 
... along . 
it does help . Dorothy , you're waking up ! 
yes -- there -- 
-- A hot water bottle would be good if we had one . 
dear , whatever shall we do ? 
oh -- 
oh , come on now - everybody -- 
no -- No -- No -- No ! 
now lookit , Dorothy , you ain't using your head about Miss Gulch . think you didn't have any brains at all . 
well , why don't you use them ? when you come home , don't go by Miss Gulch's place . then Toto won't get in her garden , and you won't get in no trouble . see ? 
why , Zeke , -- you're just as scared as I am ! 
what -- what did you do that for ? I didn't bite him . 
it's bad enough picking on a straw man , but when you go around picking on poor little dogs -- 
well , of course not . my goodness , what a fuss you're making . well , naturally , when you go around picking on things weaker than you are -- Why , you're nothing but a great big coward ! 
... has been simply unbearable . 
a home -- 
it's beautiful , isn't it ? just like I knew it would be . he really must be a wonderful Wizard to live in a City like that ! 
yes -- let's run ! 
oh -- unusual weather we're having , ain't it ? 
ho -- ho --ho -- ho 
I'll be home in time for supper ! 
your Majesty , if you were king You wouldn't be afraid of anything ? 
how about a hippopotamus ? 
Supposin' you met an elephant ? 
I'd be too scared to ask him for it . 
I'd sooner wait outside . 
because I'm still scared ! 
oh -- Oh , come on . 
does it work ? 
oh -- 
as Monarch of the Forest I don't like the situation . 
I'd like to roar' em down -- But I think I lost my roarer . 
did they hurtcha ? 
they're coming back ! 
... Ain't it the truth ! ain't it the truth ! 
oh , now I'll never get home ! 
oh , that's very kind of you -- but this could never be like Kansas . Auntie Em must have stopped wondering what happened to me by now . oh , Scarecrow , what am I going to do ? 
oh , my ! 
oh , my ! 
oh , my ! 
oh , my ! 
oh , my ! 
did you say something ? 
where do you want to be oiled first ? 
... m ... m ... my , my , my , my goodness -- I can talk again ! oh -- oil my arms , please -- oil my elbows . 
oh -- 
no -- it feels wonderful . I've held that axe up for ages . oh --- 
well , you're perfect now . 
oh -- 
oh , oh , oh , oh , oh , oh , oh , are you all right ? 
oh , dear -- That was wonderful ! you know -- we were just wondering why you couldn't come to Emerald City with us to ask the Wizard of Oz for a heart . 
well , suppose the Wizard wouldn't get me one when we got there ? 
oh , goodness ! did any of them sting you ? 
oh , dear . I don't know what I'd do if a whole swarm kept -- Oh ! oh ! oh , there's one on me ! 
oh , see - I killed it . oh , I killed that poor little honey bee ! 
and I was standing over there rusting for the longest time . 
we might . 
and bears ! 
and him a brain . 
can't that female take no for an answer ? 
no . why only -- Oh -- 
oh ! something bit me , too ! 
Dorothy ! 
tomorrow ? oh , but I want to go home now . 
ahh --- Oh , it ticks ! listen ! 
... yes . 
now I know I've got a heart --' cause it's breaking . 
that dog's a menace to the community . I'm taking him to the sheriff and make sure he's destroyed . 
now you're seeing reason . 
here's what I'm taking him in -- so he can't attack me again . 
here ! I've got an order ! let me have ... 
let's see -- you're -- you're travelling in disguise . no , that's not right . I -- you're -- you're going on a visit . no , I'm wrong . that's ... You're -- running away . 
Professor marvel never guesses -- he knows ! now , why are you running away ? 
no , no -- now don't tell me . they -- they don't understand you at home . they don't appreciate you . you want to see other lands -- big cities -- big mountains -- big oceans -- 
yes -- 
oh , yes - you - you wanted to go home , huh ? 
oh -- 
aw , come , come , come -- 
oh -- 
that's our farm ! 
... her face is careworn . 
her -- her name is Emily . 
well , I -- I can't quite see . why , she's crying . 
someone has hurt her -- someone has just about broken her heart . 
Uh-huh . 
... room -- 
... paper ? 
... bed . 
but -- what's this ? I thought you were going along with me . 
oh -- 
are you a good witch , or a bad witch ? 
Toto's my dog . 
the Munchkins are happy because you have freed them from the wicked Witch of the East . 
the little people who live in this land -- it's Munchkinland , and you are their national heroine , my dear . it's all right -- you may all come out and thank her . it's all right now - you may all come out . 
oh , I'd give anything to get out of Oz altogether -- but which is the way back to Kansas ? I can't go the way I came . 
oh , very good , but very mysterious . he lives in the Emerald City , and that's a long journey from here . did you bring your broomstick with you ? 
well , then , you'll have to walk . the Munchkins will see you safely to the border of Munchkinland . and remember , never let those Ruby slippers off your feet for a moment , or you will be at the mercy of the wicked Witch of the West . 
oh , will you help me ? can you help me ? 
oh , now ? 
are you ready now ? 
what are you going to do with my dog ? give him back to me ! 
oh , please give me back my dog ! 
but the Good Witch of the North told me not to . 
no ! no -- no ! here -- you can have your old slippers -- but give me back Toto . 
ahh ! ah ! 
run , Toto , run ! 
oh ! oh , it feels like my joints are rusted . listen , Dorothy , don't let hunk kid you about Miss Gulch . she's just a poor sour-faced old maid that -- she ain't got no heart left . you know , you should have a little more heart yourself , and have pity on her . 
this ? 
oh ! 
Hickory ! 
oh ! oh , Zeke ! help ! help me , Zeke ! get me out of here ! help ! 
Uhhhh -- yes ... 
Yes-s-s -- that ... that's exactly so . I'm a humbug ! 
frightened ? you are talking to a man who has laughed in the face of death -- sneered at Doom and chuckled at catastrophe . I was petrified . then suddenly the wind changed , and the balloon floated down into the heart of this noble city , where I was instantly acclaimed Oz , the First Wizard de Luxe ! 
times being what they were , I accepted the job , -- retaining my balloon against the advent of a quick get-away . and in that balloon , my dear Dorothy , you and I will return to the land of E Pluribus Unum ! 
I can't come back ! I don't know how it works ! 
our echo . 
oh , come on - come on ! we'll soon find the Wizard ! 
... have you come back ? 
... resourceful ! 
if you were really great and powerful , you'd keep your promises ! 
... -- Oz -- has spoken ! 
well , I -- I -- I am the Great and powerful -- Wizard of Oz . 
as Mayor of the Munchkin City In the County of the Land of Oz I welcome you most regally 
to see ? 
if she ? 
then this is a day of Independence For all the Munchkins and their descendants ! 
from now on you'll be history 
look at you , Zeke -- you're just as white -- 
well , Dorothy was walking along the -- 
all right , Mrs. Gale . but some day they're going to erect a statue to me in this town , and -- 
poor little orphan , and her Miss Gulch troubles . gosh all hemlock - you know , she ought to have somebody to play with . 
yes . 
uhh -- yeah -- 
Aunt Em ! 
just listen to what Miss Gulch did to Toto ! she -- 
seventy -- Dorothy , please ! 
Dorothy ! Dorothy ! we're busy ! 
now , Dorothy , dear , stop imagining things . you always get yourself into a fret over nothing . 
Dorothy ! 
-- no place like home -- there's no place like home -- no place -- 
oh , Auntie Em -- it's you ! 
but I did leave you , Uncle Henry -- that's just the trouble . and I tried to get back for days and days . 
oh , we dream lots of silly things when we -- 
is this where we're going ? 
momma ... are they angry with us . 
I don't want to stay here . 
I wish dawdie was with us . 
no , you listen . get out ! 
you might have killed him ! 
get back in there . 
she say where he is ? 
what about Carter ? 
weird , man . no fuckin' electricity . what do you figure they plug all their shit into ? 
he's not in this building . 
never seen anything like that in all my years . 
we'll , them Ohio Amish sure must be different . our Lancaster brethren , they just don't have that kind of fight in them . 
you're Rachel Lapp , aren't you ? 
who was that man ? 
is the English dead ? 
that has no place in this house . 
didn't you hear Stoltzfus ? what if he dies ? then the sheriff will come . they'll say we broke their laws – 
Rachel , this is a man's life , we hold it in our hands . 
Eli , John is a carpenter . as well as being a fine policeman . 
how can this be ? how can you do such a thing ? is this plain ? is this the ordnung ? 
eh ? nothing ? Rachel , you bring this man to our house . with his gun of the hand . you bring fear to this house . fear of English with guns coming after . you bring blood and whispers of more blood . now English music ... and you are dancing to English music ! and you call this nothing ? 
no sin ? maybe . not yet . but , Rachel , it does not look ... Don't you know there has been talk ? talk about you , not him . talk about going to the Bishop . about having you ... shunned ! 
do not make light of it , Rachel . they can do it ... quick ! like that ! and then ... then I can not sit at table with you . I can not take a thing from your hand . I ... I can not go with you to meeting ! Rachel , good Rachel , you must not go too far ! dear child ! 
I will be the judge of that . 
you shame yourself . 
I have to help him ! 
yes , thank you very much . 
yes . 
good morning . 
I wanted to. you were kind to take us in last night . anyway , I needed something to do . I was so angry with your brother . he's so ... agaanisish ! 
just a minute . I'll pour you some coffee . 
I made it a contest ... the one who does best gets his cereal back first . children like to help ... they only need to be kept after a little bit . 
Fred . the way he looked when you screamed at him . 
at home you'd never hear a woman scream at a man that way . 
you just wouldn't . it's not the Amish way . but I think it would have done me good if I could have screamed at your brother last night . 
did you find him ? 
Elaine , I've come to apologize for Lt. McElroy . he overstated the department's position . 
of course , Elaine . but as long as there's any question , better Johnny should come back and clear his name . 
Elaine , I don't want to have to take you in for questioning . you've got his car , you were the last to see him – 
you know where he is . 
you'd lie to protect him . 
you admit you're lying ? 
either you're a member of the club or you aren't , Elton . tell me what you know ... 
anybody know about this ? 
I got there late , John . 
listen carefully , I wrote the Amish woman's name and address on my desk calendar , I want you to lose it for me , Now . tonight . 
nothing . I'm not going to be around for a while . I'll call you when I can . 
yeah ... I can put it all together when I get back ,' til then , you know nothing , understand ? business as usual ... 
it's me . 
never mind . I'm coming in to take care of business . how hot am I ? 
I'm coming . 
you hear me ? 
that's more like it . where are you at , anyway ? 
say again ? 
I'm a police officer . I'm going to have to talk to the boy . what's his name ? 
where are you taking us ? 
you have no right to keep us here . 
you don't understand , we have nothing to do with your laws ! 
what was that ? 
the problem is I don't happen to think my son should be spending all his time with a man who carried a gun under his coat and goes around whacking people . 
yes . and I also want to leave this city . 
we do not go into your courts . 
look , I'm genuinely sorry ... 
they kid a lot . 
but not a good tired . 
your sister said you don't have a family ? 
she thinks you should get married and have children of your own . instead of trying to be a father to hers . except she thinks you're afraid of the responsibility . 
why don't you arrest that man ? are you protecting him because policeman ? 
but why would they murder ... 
I'm afraid . I'm afraid for Samuel . I want to go home . 
home . 
you said we would be safe in Philadelphia . 
stay for awhile . rest . I'll make coffee and breakfast . 
but John ... why didn't you go to a hospital ? 
but why ? 
who are they ? 
only the elders . 
what ? 
two days . 
John Book , I would appreciate it if , during the time you are with us , you would have as little to do with Samuel as possible . 
enjoying your reading ? 
your shirt and jacket are still stained with blood . I have them soaking.You can wear these . 
something wrong with buttons ? 
Hochmut ? 
anything against zippers ? 
telephone ? the Gunthers across the valley . they're Mennonite . they have cars and refrigerators and telephones in the houses even . 
well ... the store at Saltzburg ... But you won't be going to Saltzburg for a while . 
but Stoltzfus said ... 
the ... bullets ? 
Eli is a fine carpenter . best in the district . he and his father built the big house themselves forty years ago . 
we had some lemonade and he left . 
you know carpentry ? 
what else can you do ? 
whacking is not of much use on a farm . 
but ... You may not be well enough . 
when will you be going ? 
won him over just like that . 
you should not bother with that birdhouse . if you're leaving tomorrow . 
there was a time when I thought you might have stayed . 
there was a time when I would have welcomed it . 
I was being foolish ? 
you're so sure of that ? 
I'm not so sure of anything as you are , John Book . you could live this life if you wanted to bad enough . just as I could live yours ! 
there is always a way ! but you are such a ... a Glotzkopp you cannot see ! you'd rather go back to that city ! to nothing ! no woman ! no children ! no land ! 
what you do is take vengeance ! which is a sin against heaven ! 
that's God's way ! 
I want you to take this ... to remember by . 
how reliable is this kid ? 
Amish . 
what have you got ? 
so one of them got to him . 
you know who ? 
you're still convinced there's a link to the department ? 
that's the problem . we need results . the press is driving us crazy over this P2P thing . calling us the' speed capitol of the country' . you know the sort of thing . it's getting political . the Commissioner's getting very uneasy . 
what's-her-name moved to Buffalo . 
last guy I would have figured . but he's part of it . 
if I did , I'd have kept my mouth shut ... It fits , Paul ... fifty-five gallons of P2P confiscated four years ago ... Guess who was in on the collar ? Mac . he salts it away somewhere ... he knows the stuff is potent , but the street chemists haven't figured out how to process it . but they do now . and now the stuff is worth five-grand a pint and there are a lot of pints in a fifty-five gallon drum . 
just us . 
more people ... Gotta pick up where Zenovich left off . people from outside the department . 
what's your first move ? 
who else knows ? 
you made a mistake , Paul . you shouldn't have taken Elton out . 
Johnny – 
listen to me , Johnny . come in ! you're out there all alone ... We're getting close ... real close ... Maybe if you listen to me for a minute we can work something out so you can come in – 
it's all over , Paul . 
I saw him . 
who'd you see , Sam ? the man on the floor ? 
he was ... like him . 
you ever handle a pistol like this , Samuel ? 
tell you what – I'm going to let you handle this one . but only if you promise not to say anything to your momma . I've got a feeling she wouldn't understand . 
that's Luke . he doesn't like strangers . 
hey , Sam ... 
is it them ? 
are they going to kill you ? 
what are you going to do ? 
don't let them hurt you . 
are you really ever coming back ? 
have you got your gun on now ? 
good morning . book , is it ? you are the Yankee they talk about ? 
Eli says you're a carpenter , Book . 
your hole is healed , then ? 
nail it ! 
everything is all right , John . 
how could you do this to me tonight ? I told you I had company 
where's Timmy and Buck ? 
you've got a man here and the kids are upstairs ? 
oh sure , Fred . 
put my car in the garage and close the door . 
you don't know anything ... borrowed your car . didn't say why . and you never heard of that woman and her boy . 
sure , I'm sorry . hope you don't mind me plugging in to your battery . mine's dead ... How can I help ? what can I do ? 
milking ? 
I've seen pictures . 
eat up , Book . what's the matter with your appetite ? 
we are emissaries of her majesty , Queen Cherlindrea , of the land of Coshairm . 
she requests the presence of your- self and the young princess . 
I'm getting her out of there ! 
Ohhh , I hate this . 
this is not going well . 
talk ! say something ! 
hey , careful there ! 
we've traveled a long way . we're looking for fin Raziel . 
obviously . 
this can't be right . this isn't a sorceress . this is some kind of animal . 
if you rest the baby on your shoulder , she'll stop crying . 
I changed her already ! 
who is that horrible friend of yours ? 
who is he ? 
she's hungry . 
here . hold her . 
watch this . right between the eyes . 
I'm not going in there . 
are you sure ? 
us ? ? we'll never catch them . any- way , we're all done , Teemo . let's go home . 
who are you ! who are you ! 
what do you want ! 
kill him ! 
no . 
you must learn magic . 
Willow . to learn magic , first you must make your own philosopher's stone ! 
I hope she's all right . how much more do I have to do of this ? 
I know , and the magician's goal is to find his true self . but what's this got to do with it ? 
I'm all finished . now what ? 
how am I gonna do that ? 
we don't have much time left ! go on ! go on ! 
what's the magician's weapon ? 
your will ! your will ! what else could it be ? 
the art of transformation ! 
Oooh , this smells terrible . 
Ouch ! ! 
what'd you bit me for ! ! 
again : what is the magician's weapon ? 
now use it . 
Tir Asleen . 
how ? ? 
I did it ! Madmartigan ! come here ! look ! you gotta see this ! I did it ! 
Raziel ! I transformed them all ! I'm a magician ! 
get down ! the ritual chant ! quick ! protect yourself ! 
just do it ! 
no ! I can still defeat Bavmorda ! 
time is running out . 
it's not a Nelwyn baby . 
can't we keep it , dada ? 
Daikinis are giant people who live far far away . 
I could be you rguard ! I could carry your spear ! 
please ? I'm dyin' of Thirst in here . 
don't make me angry , Peck . 
do any other daikinis ever come by here ? 
thanks for your help , Peck . 
as if you care . I saved your life , Peck . those guys woulda killed us ! you wanna give your baby to them ? ? they eat babies ! 
you a woodcutter ? 
you all right ? 
are you a warrior ? 
what's that ? I hear something ! 
I'll be around long after you're dead , Airk ! you slime ! when I get outa here I'll cut your head off and stick it on a pig-pole ! 
whatcha thinkin' about , Willow ? 
nobody's gonna take your baby . know why ? nobody cares ... Except me . you wanna go back to your farm . you wanna go back to your family . I could take care of that baby . I'll look after her like she was me own . 
you gotta promise to feed her . 
fresh goat's milk . 
and give her a bath everyday , and don't let her get cold . and keep her diaper changed . 
here are her diaper rags . and this is her milk bladder . and when she cries--she's either hungry or she's tired--rock her on your left shoulder . she likes that . 
you ! ! 
hey ! give me that baby ! 
time to change her diaper . 
where's the baby ? ? 
now Willow , I know you're gonna blame me for this but it wasn't my fault ... ! 
Madmartigan ! you saved her life ! 
so you're on your way to Tir Asleen , huh ? I hate to tell you this , Willow , but Tir Asleen dosn't exist . 
Madmartigan , I need your help . 
I was in love once , Willow . she had a hold on my heart . I could barely function . I * was * a great swordsman ! I was knighted ! I could have been king ! 
I'll help you ... ! 
I'm beginning to think you two * deserve * to be locked up . 
did she ask about me ? 
come on , Peck , don't give me a hard time . you were in her ten all night . did she say anything ? 
Willow ! 
she's in love . 
you ? 
Madmartigan ! I can't stand being in closed-in places . 
Willow ... this may be a bad time to ask this question but ... what if Raziel's wrong ? 
she's a bird , Willow . 
watch it ! 
I have an idea . back in my village we catch a lot of hedgehogs . 
I don't know , Willow . 
Willow , why don't you use your mag- ic to get us out of here ? 
then you get us out of here . 
who is that girl , anyway ? 
we're a tiny version of all that ? 
Bavmorda cannot transform you . I've protected this camp with a spell . 
you ! are you the mother of that child ? 
I can't . 
I can't . 
Gawd ... you're ... beautiful ... 
Mmmm , I love the smell of a woman . 
I do what I'm told . 
you're a fool . now put her back . 
say what ? 
because it's true . 
Sorsha . 
sir ! I have to talk to you . 
earlier today you tried to tell me something , Willow . 
now , you know where you're going ? down there , through those trees , follow the river . you'll know the crossroads by a big daikini struc- ture . Willow , this is serious business . don't waste any time , the outer world is no place for a Nelwyn . give the baby to the first daikini you see , then hurry home as fast as you can . 
you're strong enough . but you're going to need courage , Willow . 
oh , if I could do that I'd--I'd turn Burglekutt into a toad ! 
Willow Ufgood . 
you mean , you know who this baby belongs to ? 
no , Willow . your journey has just begun . it has been foretold that this child shall bring about the Downfall of Queen Bavmorda , whose evil powers have darkened our world . upon you depends this princess's life . 
you are the guardian , Willow . you must take her to Tir Asleen . 
you need a warrior for this job . I'm nobody . 
they look like acorns . 
we're going into battle , little one . find a woman to take care of it . 
Madmartigan ! what did you do this time ? 
I always knew you'd end up in a crow's cage . 
Airk ! come on , Airk . lemme outa here . 
you left me to die , friend . 
it's you they're after , Madmarti- gan . what did you do this time ? 
you gonna be a hero , Madmartigan ? I've lost half my men fighting Kael , and Bavmorda , and the Nock- maar army . now you and this Peck , and that magpie up in the rafters , are gonna take' em on alone ? 
you're chasing a dream . 
out for a little ride in the coun- try , Airk ? 
thank you , friend . 
well ? 
when are they coming ? 
in an hour they're gone ! 
you're not going to use it , are you ? 
yes ! 
who were they ? what do they want with me ? 
I only met him once , but that was enough . for such a little man he had quite an oversized opinion of himself . he offered me the " rare and unparalleled opportunity " to develop a new steam engine for him . he claims to have some sort of factory in Texas , I believe . said I could have the run of the place . he had all sorts of specifications . but when I questioned him closely , it became obvious he was just another mercenary businessman . both he and his partner had no real love of steam . it's sad . so few men do . 
a Southern gentlemen . I don't recall his name . I suppose it's unkind of me to say it , but he had the most disconcerting glass eye . 
are you all right ? 
he ... he's planning to kill us , isn't he ? 
it's a smelting retort . 
I beg your pardon ? 
I admire a man with a sense of humor . 
I must compliment you on Miss Thompson ... an exceptionally charming assistant . 
very good , sir ! I think my guest might be a sharpshooter by trade . 
really ? must be a dangerous business . 
sir ... I believe you have only two barrels . 
why don't we just cut this routine short ? whatever you do to us , we're not going to talk . 
you're not that big . 
still alive . hmm . I suppose that doesn't bode well for poor Bruno . 
Philistine . 
has it penetrated that adrenaline- addled skull that you are surrounded by seventy-eight of my loyal followers ? you are in my domain ! 
the U.S. is my jurisdiction . 
these lands were taken by force from Mexico in the illegal War of American aggression . 
I've even printed my own currency . 
the first . 
because I am holding all the western territories hostage , Mr. West ! a town a day will disappear ! Willard was merely a test run , a stroll in the park . next , I level all of Albuquerque ! yes , that's right . only yesterday I learned what you undoubtedly already know : your own President will be there . what an added bonus ! the gods are shining on me ! after tomorrow every American citizen will rise up and demand I be given back my humble little empire ! 
Mr. President , good to see you again , sir . sorry about all that . 
good work . really . 
but what would anyone have to gain from all this ... ? unless it were a foreign power . 
we find ourselves at the dawn of the Golden Age of Science . and it is the God-given destiny of this glorious nation to carry the torch that lights the way ! 
and ? 
... well , of course you can . Mr. President , what a surprise . what brings you here ? 
where'd he say he was going to do this ? 
don't try to bamboozle me , Colonel . has another scientist been kidnapped or not ? 
listen , in two days I'm embarking on a tour of the western territories . and I want to know at least one problem is being handled competently in my absence . 
French ? 
French ? damn it , I want my own man on this case . somebody I trust . somebody who doesn't mind breaking up the furniture ! 
look , I'm Captain James West ... 
your private train , sir . 
would you be thinking ... ramming speed , sir ? 
my name's Tyler . Frank Tyler . pleased to meet you , ma'am . 
you know , ma'am , you remind me of a pearl-handled pistol I once owned . a beautiful thing to look at , but too hot to handle . 
please do . I'm a man who appreciates a good firearm . 
well , where I come from it kind of goes with the territory . Texas . 
well , sir , you are proving to be one of my more interesting guests . 
well , I owe you one , don't I ? 
you must excuse the Doctor . no one has ever beaten him at his little game . 
have you taken a wrong turn , Mr. Tyler ? 
forgive me , but you don't strike me as the social secretary type . 
just a little insurance ... against the unexpected . 
oh , I would hope not . 
she's perfectly safe . 
my . it's gotten longer . 
you know , I really hate being toyed with before someone shoots me . 
a new friend ? 
anyone ? 
they don't even realize they should be frightened . 
terribly sorry . I'm always sticking this where it doesn't belong . Federal agents , ma'am . we're rescuing a kidnap victim ... 
he's not giving up ? 
time for you to get off , Ma'am . 
J. S. Bach . 
Artemus Gordon . Bach , he's the composer . 
valet ? you jest of course . I am a U.S. Marshal . 
congratulations . unfortunately , my train is about to leave , and I really must insist you disembark . 
interesting . mine say the same thing , and they don't mention you , not even as a valet , although we could talk ... 
funny , I was just thinking you should do the same . since I am already in residence , and am obviously the man for the job , it's been grand making your acquaintance , sir . and best of luck in all your future endeavors . 
but don't pull that again . 
eight scientists . eight different fields of endeavor . Hydraulics , optics , ballistics ... 
a giant ... hydraulically operated microscope ... that explodes ? or maybe just someone who hates scientists . 
wait a minute . now I know where I've heard of you . you're the gadget guy . 
attractive buttons , yes ? but yank one off , toss it , and poof ! it emits a cloud of sleeping gas . 
always hoping . or this ... 
all right , if it'll make you happy , I'll try that . 
your little jack-in-the-box gun . that might be useful . 
that should put us ahead of the criminals . 
Aha ! 
yes , aha . a brass screw . 
potentially . this is the painstaking process of piecing together clues . the cornerstone of the modern science of criminology . piece by piece we reconstruct the identity of the villain . 
yes . starting with a screw . now , it's not fair of me to expect someone who's spent his life wrangling with Western desperadoes to fully appreciate what I'm doing here , but ... 
Limestone quarry ? 
Doyle , once around the park . I need a moment to prepare . 
come Llewellyn , don't tarry . 
that's a lot of butler . 
doctor V. L. Pemberton . I knew it . he's a scientist all right . Inventor of the Pemberton condensed steam engine . I'm telling you , Artemus , Loveless is our man . 
you know your Morse Code almost as well as I. 
yes . now , observe .... 
you're either having a seizure or you just said " hello . " 
what was all that back there ? 
all that jumping and kicking . 
Garrison ... ? then the President was right . except it's not a foreign power , it's a bunch of die- hard Rebels trying to make the South rise again . 
could I just point out , this is a perfect example of the criminal mind exploiting modern invention . 
at least I tried something . 
damn it , this is ridiculous . 
Jim , are you all right ? 
what way is that ? 
" spontaneous . " I like that . most people say something like " hare- brained reckless son-of-a-bitch . " 
nothing much to it really . when I was younger I got into a pretty bad run-in with the Wyler Boys . I saw them coming . but I didn't act fast enough . Second-guessed myself . and it cost me ... cost me dearly . 
those kids , they took my wagon . never got it back . 
you might have mentioned you had that . 
strange ... you'd think he'd have this place better guarded . 
they're so precious when they're asleep . 
can you fill me in here ? 
thank you . 
know what this is ? 
this is good . 
oh , damn ! that's it . 
sounds like a train . looks like a train . 
Willard ... 
relax . we're almost there . 
what is that ? 
and people are actually fooled by that ? 
not again . 
when we find him , he is mine . 
what if these tracks are just leading us to an Indian village or some old coot's mining claim ? 
excellent detective work , sir . you should have the honor of going first . 
my pleasure . 
what ? President Grant is ... ! 
I don't have to tell you what that would do to our careers ! 
I'd love to stop him , but have you noticed the hundred armed men ? 
it was in your book . 
are those just button buttons or ... ? 
God in heaven , what is that ? ! 
my God ! he's so excessive ! 
pull the balloon right in front of him ! we'll board the damn thing ! 
the machine was stopped ! it seemed like a perfect time to disable it ! why'd you have to throw it into full throttle ? ! 
all right , all right ... It'll be okay . I mean , eventually it'll just run out of steam . 
Artemus ! look at that . brand spanking new . she's a beauty , huh ? let's get rolling . 
what ? you're going to drive off without even saying hi ? 
why don't you come in , have a drink ? 
I can't , Sandy . I've got to run . 
sorry , Sandy . I've got plans . 
Sandy ... What's up ? 
shit . here we go again . 
look . I know you're seeing Barbara Baxter . so what ? 
grab a clue , Sam . you're a hired hand around here . enjoy it while it lasts . 
how much is about six and a half million divided by three ? 
Sam ... 
but I .. 
yeah , right . 
I was worried about you , Suzie . I decided we should all get together , one more time , before we split up . 
that was about as grim as it gets . 
but then you knew what he was like all along ... Maybe his killing Kelly was a thing you had counted on ... 
what ? 
seems to like some of the same places you do . funny you never met . 
I've seen you out there in your old air boat , thinking about what might have been , old man Van Ryan hadn't fucked you out of it . what if I told you I had a way we could get a big piece of it back ? 
how ... 
why don't you tell us one more time , how Kelly came to be with you , alone in your house . 
I had to go look for this coupon . 
like I said , I hadn't really expected to use it . anyway , I'm going through a drawer . I hear a car . I look out the window . I see Nicole driving away . I leave my room , and there's Kelly . 
yes . 
yes . 
I could , but it's confidential . look , the point is , we didn't talk . I told her this was not an appropriate time or place . 
but she ran away . 
but you do admit to touching her , to putting your arm around her . isn't that against the rules ? 
with a thirty-five inch bustline in a wet T-shirt with no bra ... 
yeah , well , you fixed that . what the hell happened , anyway ? 
hey , what did you want me to do , die ? 
did you become squeamish about these things before or after you bludgeoned little Suzie Toller to death with a wine bottle ? Jesus , man . it couldn't have worked out better . they're convinced Kelly whacked Suzie . I can't talk' em out of it . we should be celebrating . this thing worked out just like you said , only better . 
you mean this thing ? 
I thought this was supposed to be a vacation . why didn't you buy a nice big power boat ? 
yeah , or get me drowned . 
that how you planned it ? you take cut Suzie , get me to hang it on Kelly , then dump me in the ocean ... 
meet my partner , Gloria Perez . 
it's Celine . he's okay . he had a pretty good line on what cheap fucks people are . 
no . 
it doesn't look like it . 
you ought to watch it with that shit , Suzie . you get busted again , you go back in a two-tine loser . 
that's cop bullshit . 
about what ? 
is this supposed to mean something to me ? what triangle ? 
I don't have to listen to this . and you can't shove me around . I have friends now ... 
I don't mean who you're thinking . I have other friends ... 
get away from me . 
Davy . 
you ... I should've killed you myself. should never have left it up to him ... 
Sam , for godsake . 
you're saying that Kelly was raped by Sam Lombardo . 
who is it ? 
where is she ? 
I'm placing your daughter under arrest . 
but check this ... 
good thinking . 
forget it . 
what's that supposed to mean ? 
Nellie Gail Ranch ... 
there's nothing for them to get . 
I just want my life back ... 
come on , let loose ! 
you'll get over it . we've got a knockdown , airtight , motherfucker of a lawsuit against Sandra Van Ryan . 
just like that ? these people ruined your life , bro . 
where's the hose ? we can set up . 
aren't you forgetting something ? your coupon . we gotta have it . 
rules are rules , Mr. Lombardo . 
Kelly ... 
how much ? 
God , you scared the shit out of me . you must be crazy coming here . 
the only way we're gonna blow this now , is if we do it ourselves ... 
we have to stick with the plan . 
Kelly . is Suzie there ? 
shit . I was afraid of that . she left this garbled message on my machine . can you calm her down ? 
you know what it takes . 
I'm here . 
I'm sorry , Kelly . I'm sorry it had to happen like this . she was losing it ... 
hello ? 
Duquette . forget him ... 
yeah , he got her busted for possession ... 
and you believe her ? 
Kelly ... Relax . take one of your mom's Valium or something . in another week you get on the plane . it's over . we're rich . 
so if they're tapping your phone , we're dead . stay in the guest house . skip the graduation parties . you'll never see Duquette . okay ? I love you . 
that never seemed to worry you at the Glades . 
I love you . now give me the line . 
I'm running away . 
is that Sam Lombardo ? 
which one of your " bodyguards " is that ? 
okay , what's the matter ? 
my friends buy me clothes , so I don't look like trash . 
Kelly . what is it ? 
Jesus . well , I do too , sometimes ... 
I was raped . by Sam Lombardo . 
you didn't have to fly back -- from -- wherever , for me ... 
don't bother . I'm taking a trip . 
excuse me ? 
the thing about it is , threesomes so rarely work out . 
get off my property . 
will you calm down . Duquette's gonna come to you just like he did to me . you're gonna have to be ready for him . 
yeah , I've got family and they've got clout and now you have me . right ? and Sam . believe me , Suzie , this dickhead's not going to send you anywhere . he's gonna try and rattle your cage , and that's it . stay strong and he can't do shit . 
I can't believe you called Sam . what's the matter with you ? 
you're gonna fuck me over , aren't you ? 
you are . 
anybody ever tell you that stuff will rot your brain ? 
what are you looking at ? 
I thought we were goin' to a movie . 
I wanna live at the beach someday . 
it's those rocks , up there . 
yeah , sometimes . lots of the kids hang out here . you really think something bad happened to Suzie ? 
I say something funny ? 
way I hear it , he was pretty tight with the kids , one of the guys ... 
come on . beats study hall , doesn't it ? 
thank you , Jimmy . 
what about you , Jimbo , you need a ride ? 
a ride . you want one ? 
you guess ? did he or didn't he ? 
and then what ... he touched you ? did you maybe flirt a little ... 
what did you do then ? 
Suzie ! did this man rape you ? 
he pushed into me ... I couldn't stop him ... it hurt . 
Ms. Toller ? 
Ms. Toller . I'm asking you now , under oath , did Samuel Lonbardo rape you ? 
I'm sorry ? 
the line I get on this guy , is that he's done half the women in Blue Bay . 
what about witnesses ? 
are you crazy , Ray ? 
Ray . the conversation on this tape is totally unintelligible . what we have here , is you on the Van Ryan property , without a proper warrant , shooting a porn flick ... 
oh , Ray ... no ... 
Kelly's next , Gloria . 
I fucked up . I lost control of the situation , the one thing they train you for ... God , what did I do ? 
she bit you ? 
I told her I was coming with her . she nodded , like she understood . we stood up together . 
the teeth , were they ... 
why ? 
that doesn't make him a child rapist . there's something else . this girl's had some problems . wrecked a couple of her mom's cars . ran away ... 
I want a full-scale investigation . 
that bothers you ? 
you didn't tell me you were gonna put me on the fucking news . 
he dropped Jimmy off first ? 
and when he arrived at your house , was anyone there ? 
so you were alone . 
did he come in with you ? 
at that point were you able to fight him off ? 
he did say something . 
I've got that two o'clock in town . 
that would make it about the time of her old man's suicide . you don't think that could explain some erratic behavior ? 
it's our job , Gloria . 
same as him . they saw her come . they saw her go . they saw him follow . 
we failed to mention the mower guy's a drunk , that he was after more beer and never really saw Kelly go into the house , so he can't say how long she was in there . same with the kids . they saw her running down the street , but that's it . with no physical evidence , what do we have ? her word against his . 
you can go up to one of those trees and peel the bark . you know what you get ? more bark . and more bark . there's no core . tree's not good tar anything but sucking up water . and now they can't get rid of them . they've tried poisons . nothing works . they don't die . 
the skinny brunette . 
you saw the news today ? 
think back , before the suit was filed , before the trial . Lombardo had an affair with Sandra , right ? so why not tell us about the affair ? I mean it could be a hell of a motive for Kelly to fabricate her charge in the first place . 
I thought of that . then I said , come on , you're Lombardo . your reputation is getting trashed . you want to stop the bleeding . you don't want to sit in jail for three months . unless ... 
why ? you ask me , Lombardo had it pretty good already , nice job in a beautiful setting , popular , an active social life . he's gonna put this all on the line for some dicey play like what you're describing ... 
her father didn't leave her squat . the kid's got money in trust from her grandfather , but she can't touch that till her mother dies and Sandra seems to have the idea that Kelly ought to learn the value of a buck . 
I flat don't like the guy , glory . he's dirty . and I'll tell you something else . you want to know how old man Lombardo lost his money ? he was fucked out of it by old man Van Ryan , on a little item known as the Salt Creek Land deal . it was after the war . van Ryan set up a corporation to develop swamp land , got investors like Lombardo to put up money , then turned around and got the state to declare the area an ecological preserve , on the sly , of course , but everyone knew it was him . the freeway went to the coast , right where Van Ryan wanted it . 
you got it . the rich got richer . while the saps like Lombardo went belly-up in the swamp . 
I net a guy in a bar . 
guess I kind of lost it there . 
were you ever in a situation where you could see a thing coming and you didn't do what you could to stop it ? 
Ray . we don't know anything yet . she could be anywhere ... 
just check out the car . 
those are Suzie Toller's teeth . 
the swamp , most likely ... Lombardo's a swamp rat , knows the body will never be found there . but he's made a mistake . 
poor dumb Suzie , she never had a chance . 
will you do me one favor ? 
and if the teeth aren't Suzie's ? you'll give this up ? 
I'm tired , Ray . I'm going home . 
he's leaving the country . and I don't give a shit . 
it's Homicide's job now , Ray , let' em do it . I'll tell you something else , there's more to this story than you know , Ray ... If Suzie is dead , I think Hunter may be on the right track ... 
did you call anyone ? did you call her house to see if she got home ? did you call the Masons ? 
Suzie Toller is missing . 
she didn't cone home last night . we found her car at the bus terminal , but nothing to suggest she bought a ticket . 
Ray thinks she was murdered . 
Kelly's file . read it . you're going to find an angry , sexually confused girl who's made threats on her mother's life and a female lover she'd never identify . 
how are you , Kelly ? would you like to take a break for a minute ? 
the next thing ... his hand was in my shorts ... you know , from behind . his fingers ... his fingers ... 
I understand . 
was there penetration ? did he put himself inside you ? 
that's okay , Kelly . you're doing fine . but I have to ask you something here . when you say it hurt . was this the first time a man was inside you ? 
I ... he had my wrists pinned behind me . I remember my hands were cold .' 
he kept saying , " Let it happen , let it happen . " then he just stopped . 
not at first . he was still inside but he wasn't moving or anything ... He said we had this secret . and that now he'd be able to help me ... because we were close ... Something like that . I don't know . it's hard to remember , exactly . 
Gator can't see what's in front of it for shit . they see out the sides . that one don't even know Walter's arm's in his mouth . 
I was wondering if I could ask you a few questions . 
actually , I was wondering if I might ask you about Ray Duquette . 
got sort of hung up on her , from what hear . 
no . not after that night . I don't know what happened . maybe he caught her with some john ... All I know is , the next morning the girl was gone and there was a dead boy ... Indian kid named Davy . used to live down the road there in a wrecked car . him and Suzie were at the Glades that night . it was right after that , Ray got Suzie busted and sent her away . that's what there is to say about Ray Duquette . 
wasn't enough Van Ryan had to destroy the people who invested here . he got to be old , he and his rich cronies would come down here , hunt and whore , act like assholes . one trip he showed up with this young girl he'd picked up somewhere , gotten her pregnant then dumped her in the swamp . that came with her . 
she had it , before she drank herself to death . wasn't exactly a love child ... 
raised her like she was , but no , Walter's my only child . he was a good boy , till the army took him . 
you okay ? 
how soon can we get something ? 
Merritt , forensics . 
Ray . stop calling . I told you the dental records will take time ... 
could be hers . types match . could be a lot of other people's too ... 
not that I'm going to be much good after last night ... 
is that Sandra Van Ryan's kid ? 
she's going to wash your Jeep ? 
you look pretty . 
hey , I've got it , I may as well spend it , right ? I've always wanted to live where I could dive for my dinner . 
I was thinking , Antigua , maybe . 
talk to me Artie . 
... is accusing me of rape . Jimmy told me . apparently I'm the last to know ... 
all I can tell you Sam , is hang in there . they clear you of this mess , you get reinstated , with back pay ... 
in a hurry , are we ? 
bad news . 
I'm just a messenger . 
my parents ? what do you mean ? 
you've got the wrong guy . the closest my parents have been to the Amazon is the Brazilian Pavilion at Epcot . 
how quaint . 
are you familiar with " Heaven ? " 
your fathered owned the entire " Heaven " empire . you own it now . any questions ? 
uh , sure . Uncle Billy . 
of course I like girls . 
as much as possible . 
the parties are held in here when the weather dips below seventy . which is seldom . 
ah , in other words , this is the apres-orgy salon ? 
maybe she needs help , Ted . you should be a gentleman . 
there you are , Ted-baby . everything all right ? 
you ready for your big coming out party ? everybody's dying to meet you . 
they said that ? really ? oh , your parents . the Nelson's . right , right . how Midwest . I like that . 
all those people out there . it's a lot of pressure . 
I do ? 
you're the Sultan of semen . the Monarch of masturbation . the merchant Prince of lust . you . Ted . are the King of coitus . 
the Supreme sovereign of Sexuality . 
I told you you could do it . 
you were the new and improved you . 
no one will be laughing at you now , Ted . you can take that to the bank . 
you ARE home . but go ahead , finish school , do what you feel you need to do . in the meantime , I'll be your point person here on the magazine . 
I've been very lazy for a long , long time . 
I never finished school myself . never had to . my brother built this empire from nothing but his wife's perky tits and a whole lot of gumption . he gave me a cushy job on a silver platter . I never struggled for a second . 
it's not like I didn't have ideas , I had plenty of ideas . but I never even shared them with your father . never had the guts . 
well ... for one thing ... I think it's despicable that we exclude so many women that only fit our western notion of " classic beauty . " 
the world is a big , beautiful place . we can open new markets in Africa and Asia . imagine the Dali Lhama reading our magazine . 
at our press conference tomorrow , I think we should announce our plans to explore the world . not just a few leggy 36D's , with blond hair upstairs and down . 
don't forget to tell them all your qualifications . 
so far , so good . some of them have real Angel potential . 
my father must've been amazing . 
I never saw anybody turn so many shades of red . 
it was incredible . the light , the crowd , everything . 
seriously ? I'm doing all right ? 
I owe it all to you . without your help I'd be lost . 
I'd love to , but I really need to crack the books . final exams are coming up and I've been slacking . 
thanks , Uncle Billy . thanks for everything . 
yes ? 
I loved my brother . I stood by his wishes to let his son run the company . a son he never knew . a son that he and his wife gave away at birth . a son who was raised in a world quite different from our own . nevertheless , I was there for the lad . I guided him as best I could . but he's only seventeen , with a mind of his own and judgment that is , well , frankly , not a chip off the old block . there is only one clear solution ... And I think we all know what that is-- 
what are you doing ? 
thanks for teaching me an important lesson . what makes a family is love , not blood . 
that's right . and guess who's the new King of the unemployment Line . 
I like you , Ted . you know that . I liked you before you were filthy rich . 
I'll be blunt . I know you can take it . 
Ted , you are the best editor this school paper ever had . you don't need to be pandering flesh . it's nonsense . it's beneath you . 
that's a good start , yes . a very good start . 
have you ever even looked at " Heaven ? " 
with all due respect to Merk , he doesn't have to read my magazine . but he has no right to stop others . ever hear of the First Amendment ? 
honestly , Merk . it's like you were never seventeen and the head of a media empire . 
come on , it's our only senior prom . 
you're crossing the line , Mr. Nelson . 
I'm warning you . 
you kicked us off your turf , Merk . don't rain on our parade . 
what law , Merk ? having fun ? letting down our hair on prom night ? 
you called the cops on us ? 
what is this ? does everybody know everything I'm about to say or do every freakin' minute of the day ? 
what about Charlie ? you boys could make it a little adventure . 
I'm all right , Mom . I'm not in Siberia , you know . 
yeah , I'm doing fine . I have so much to tell you . I don't even know where to begin . 
well ? surprised ? 
just a few tokens of my affection . I'll be back soon , don't worry . 
oh , good lord . are those Neptunes ? 
you promise you'll finish school ? 
you don't have to work another day in your lives . 
don't you get it ? in one day I earn more interest than the store's entire annual revenue . 
you're free . you can do anything you ever wanted to do ! 
but who would run the store ? 
everything I am is because of you . can you ever forgive me ? 
so , William Randolph . your last big scoop contrasted the popularity of Rice Crispie treats and chocolate Snickerdoodles at the annual bake sale . 
the school dumpsters used to overflow to the point where the stench was unbearable . my award winning exposé changed all that . the city added an extra weekday trash pick-up . 
look , I loved " exposed ! " and I hate it that you got busted . I know the school paper sucks in comparison , but it's really not THAT BAD . 
Christy's a very talented journalist . I see a Pulitzer in her future . 
Me-ow . 
I have absolutely no intention-- 
I tried to warn you , William Randolph . she's got stiletto heels hidden in those Keds . 
it's so nice to have friends like you , Christy . 
your article sucked . 
in the sense that there is no " hidden agenda " behind a bake sale that raised five hundred dollars for seeing eye dogs . 
come on , Julie . don't screw up . you have some real talent . 
I'm trying to help . 
what do you want from me ? I'm trying to be fair . but I can't keep you on staff if you turn every PTA meeting into an Agent Orange cover up . 
me ? 
different how ? different like a dwarf at a basketball game ? or different like a lesbian in pumps ? 
could everybody else tell you were different , or were you the only one who knew ? 
I see . so more like a tight rope Walker who secretly wants to be a trapeze artist . 
she said peanuts , you cretin . 
don't write that part . 
write what you want . just try not to make it so obvious that you're crazy about me . 
I did my homework . your grandfather was a peach farmer . 
undoubtedly an aristocratic bartender of some sort . 
I bet there are lots and lots of mirrors on Planet Ted . 
and this is not my first time on a private jet , so quit acting like I'm Rebecca of Sunnybrook Farm . 
well ? what do you think of her ? 
why can't you be nice to me ? 
wow ... you clean up nice . 
where are we going ? 
I can't believe your dad built this for you . 
whatever . 
he cared enough to want you to have it . 
I doubt it . 
the ozone must be fully depleted on Planet Ted . 
your dad taught you everything . 
a father is nothing but sperm , Ted . it takes a real man to be a dad . 
it's incredibly simple . 
eventually you'll let go . 
then you'll see who's really holding on to you . 
I know . 
but you never do . 
cut to the chase , William Randolph . your audience is way ahead of you . 
that's two words . and I'm out of the " exposed " business , remember ? I need to graduate . besides , Merk's a boy scout . 
you forget , I dislike YOU at least as much as him . 
a good journalist can take lemons and make lemonade . I'm honing my craft . 
that's probably my office . 
I got an anonymous tip and an address in Cincinnati . 
I don't know . this place seems pretty tame . 
at least it's not another 4-H meeting or a Big Brother barbecue . 
look at us . it's one o'clock in the morning , on a school night . we're in a smoky nightclub , hoping to catch our principal with some big city tart . 
that has more to do with your proximity to me . 
I have a bit of a goosebump fetish . not many people know that . 
shoes , if you want to know the truth . shoes are my thing . 
my fantasy is a totally naked woman , wearing nothing but a Timex and suede clogs . 
what about you ? 
tell me more . 
I see . 
a Portuguese boyfriend . sounds very " Cosmo . " 
turned out to be a scoundrel , eh ? I saw that one coming . 
do you trust me , Julie ? 
come on . 
I want you to trust me . 
Julie , I'll tell you something that is the god's honest truth . I've seen a lot of really beautiful girls . I mean a lot . but none of them make me feel like you do . 
I have to be honest with you , Ted . I really despise " The Girls of Xenia . " 
I mean your pictorial . it bothers me , profoundly . 
you're telling me you don't get aroused by a roomful of naked breasts . 
which explains the continued success of " Heaven " for how many decades ? 
you think you're working with chimps here ? 
Julie , wow . I was afraid you left . I was afraid I'd never see you again . 
very ambitious . I like that . 
I graduated from college . did great , summa cum laude and all . and I'm about to launch a brand new magazine called " exposed ! " an homage to Miss Julie Conroy of Xenia , Ohio . 
yellow pages ? 
they're playing our song . dare I ask for this dance ? 
Mom , Dad . meatloaf has come to represent all that Ted hates about his mediocre life and the world we live in . he's what you'd call clinically bummed . 
James , what are you doing here ? 
Sheryl Petersen is , what , nine years old , what does she know ? 
impressive . this is bigger than our whole house . 
they say money can't buy happiness but this is a reasonably good facsimile . 
my new bike . 
I came to ask permission to take custody of your room . 
better view , more spacious , new carpet . it's a no-brainer . 
Mom and Dad said it's yours . they seem to think you're coming home . 
if you could just sign right there . 
just a formality . 
are you kidding ? Mom and Dad discover I'm gone and I'll be doing hard time . 
aside from the fact that Mom's eyes are nearly swollen shut from crying and Dad spends all his time under the car trying to fix stuff that isn't broken , things couldn't be better . 
you can't come back . that is , you can , but your things will be in the room you currently think of as mine . 
funny you should say that . my Grandfather was a peach farmer . 
I meant biologically . 
I didn't forget . 
great . 
how are the hometown folks treating you , back in Xenia ? 
are they hitting you up for donations ? asking you to sponsor the local quilting bee ? 
what about the future ? you planning to rock the boat at all ? stir things up in " Heaven ? " 
no problem , consider it done . I had this idea of shooting on location . outdoors , you know ? maybe at some famous Xenia landmarks . you think that would be a problem ? 
it's a little more serious than that , Bill . the stockholders have requested a meeting . they want our guarantee that this will never happen again . some of them are even calling for Ted's resignation . 
your parents never wanted to interfere with your life , Ted . they knew your Mom and Dad loved you very much . they knew they did the right thing . but that doesn't mean they didn't watch you and miss you , from afar . 
I wondered about them , for so many years . I wondered if I looked like them , acted like them . I wondered why they gave me up . 
my legacy . 
they're not my parents , Helen . my parents are back in Xenia and I hurt them very much . 
and the girl I love , she hates " Heaven . " if I keep it , she'll never respect me . 
but if you're watching this , then it means we bit the dust . 
if you're anything like yours truly , then you probably figure we didn't want you when you were born , so who cares if we're dead ? am I right ? 
we had no idea the nudie magazine we started in the garage would turn into all this . 
before we knew it , we created the most popular men's magazine in the entire nation . the rest is history . 
I-I don't have the keys . 
you do know how to drive ? 
now release the brake . and slide the stick into first gear . 
the first time can be awkward . you just have to get on and try again . 
it's your car . these are all your cars . 
your father liked shifting . he said it brought him closer to the engine . " like a woman , purring with ecstasy . " 
I know . I'm Ginger . Miss April . 
that's me . 
hey , Ted . wanna go shopping ? 
don't worry . he found the chocolate room . 
who exactly ARE you ? 
or do you have a taste for the good life , Ted ? it's in your blood . 
Teddy ? I was thinking . 
after graduation ... maybe we could go away together ? 
Ted ! do something ! 
this is humiliating . we're being ejected from a prom ! 
well ? 
we understand your disappointment , Teddy . Christy is a pretty , sexy , provocative , voluptuous ... We ... uh ... we understand your disappointment . 
I remember spring break of my senior year . seems like a lifetime ago . 
remember how you struggled through that whole facts of life talk and then found out I knew more than you ? 
it was the year of the rhizopus rot . Grandpa almost lost the farm . you sacrificed your dream to go to the prize hog festival . and in the end you saved the peaches and you didn't have to slaughter your sow . 
sometimes you have to do stuff you don't want to do . it's all part of growing up . and it usually works out peachy in the end . 
you guys are my parents . 
they didn't want me when I was born . why should I care ... 
well , why should I ? 
I guess . 
yeah . 
I guess we could go to Disneyland or something . 
like one of those " National Geographic " specials with the topless chicks ? 
I guess it's better than having tribal patterns carved in my face . 
Ted , it's your dad . I have a question for you . I don't know how to put it tactfully . you know I'm lousy with words . 
I know they were simple people , but did this trip help your college fund at all ? 
finally , some gratitude . 
but those are our dreams , son . we have to make them come true . 
it's okay . you need me ? 
I paid off the mortgage ! I ordered that Winnebago you always wanted ! now you're ashamed of me ? 
that is your dream , not mine . my dream is so far beyond anything YOU PEOPLE could even imagine . 
shut your pie hole , Jimmy . 
we have a truckload of strawberries arriving on Tuesday morning . 
we can't accept it . it's much too expensive . right , dear ? 
sweetheart , what is it ? 
we wanted you and Jimmy to have it someday . something real and honest . 
you have to understand . this was a big shock , for all of us . one minute you're our little boy , of whom we could not be more proud . the next minute you're the owner of this whole pornographic empire . 
we're not ashamed of you , Teddy . we don't approve of the magazine or the models or the so-called " flesh parties " you attend . but we can get past all that . 
we think you should give up the magazine . sell it . let someone else run it . whatever it takes . 
wouldn't it be awesome if we were about to say the exact same thing ? 
ladies first . I insist . 
yeah ? 
yeah ? 
Teddy ? would you please please please take me to the prom ? 
Ted , have you lost your mind ? 
I don't LIKE you . we're JUST friends . 
oh , Ted , duh . I smile at everyone since I got my braces off . 
so that's a maybe ? 
great jacket , Teddy Bear . 
Christy ? you want to be in " Heaven ? " 
I thought I'd be nervous , but you sure know how to make a girl feel relaxed , Teddy Bear . 
I have to admit , I am so totally turned on . we should do it . now . 
you know ... take the pictures ? 
which you pulled , hard ! 
I miss those days , when schoolyard sexual harassment was without consequence . 
well ? 
I mean , what do you think ? 
I was always too shy to admit how much I liked you . 
maybe on the outside . but inside , deep down , I've always been dripping with special sauces . are you hungry ? 
what gives , Don Corleone ? 
new Hushpuppies don't make a new man . 
that explains the emptiness that haunts me . 
not bad for a hack . he has a future in yellow journalism . 
naked girls , wild sex , video games . no wonder it's called " Heaven . " 
never say never . 
let me get this straight ... 
these are real , live women ? 
come on , bro . spare yourself the humiliation , the degradation ... 
don't get me wrong . we can salivate over all the Christy Malones of our lives . wishing we could devour them like melt-in-your-mouth filet mignon . but we're strictly hamburger guys . ground chuck , sixty eight percent lean , is about the best we can hope for . 
I genuinely think she wants me . I feel a vibe . 
see ? did you see that ? 
the only chick more untouchable than Christy Malone is Miss April . " hi , my name's Ginger . I love tofu burgers , rainy nights , and riding bareback . my biggest turn-off is cell phones during sex . " here's a tip : set it on VIBRATE , honey , and don't be stingy with the lube . don't knock it till you tried it . 
one thing for sure , Christy Malone ain't lookin THAT good naked . 
you have a better chance of being hit by a Mack truck with a refrigerated cargo bed full of sirloin tip . 
that's crazy talk . 
don't do it , Ted . don't do it . 
think about it ... Long tunnel , bright lights , it's full of vaginal symbolism . 
seriously , it's like we're being reborn . we really could reinvent ourselves here , just like you said . nobody knows about your massive humiliation . 
nobody knows about your constant masturbation . 
what are the odds of there being ANOTHER Ted Nelson on our flight ? 
who the hell was your father ? 
... A bouncer ? are you serious ? 
this is the life , baby . we get ourselves some tail and we're talking spring BREAK ! 
don't you know anything about limo etiquette ? everything in here is included for our pleasure . 
I can't believe that's your mother . we're talking babe-a-licious chub fest , right here in the 501's . 
this is like my every wet dream come true . I don't even care that you're here , too , bro . 
this isn't some 80's porno film , you dip shit . there are no wild sex orgies . 
I'd kiss your mother with this mouth . I mean , if she wasn't , you know ... 
check this out . hurry ! 
hurry . 
check it out ! 
beauty ? no . we're talking goddess . 
dead ? 
then there must be a whole room , made completely of chocolate . 
don't be such a pansy . all of this is yours . 
I'd feel like staying up all night ! forever ! or at least till I got the lay of the land , SO TO speak . 
oh , how inappropriate is that ! 
how would you like it if I did that to your mother's panties ? 
a couple of boys fighting over a pair of red silk panties is nothing compared to what he's seen . 
you're late , bro ! 
you'll never believe who's in there . 
I feel like I've just been hit by a Mack truck . 
I thought I loved her . 
hell yes , all hundred and seventeen of' em ! 
and while you're at it , I'll take ten dozen of those puppies with the springy heads . 
get them together . 
holy stinkers , what were you thinking ? 
you got everything you ever wanted . 
Dr STECKLER ? 
dead ? 
no - she isn't in any trouble is she ? 
I shouldn't really - I'm not your surgeon ... 
sugar ? 
angel ... 
I'm really very sorry - I was banking on this coming through , because it's only five minutes from my surgery ... 
I'm sorry , I didn't mean to shout ... 
you're a novelist - why didn't you tell me ? 
her husband left her 
I thought it was you - how are you ? 
that's good 
yes , that would be nice - I'll call round some time ... 
it's been what , three years ? 
what brings the rats out of the sewers ? 
you think I'm the white angel ? 
at home alone - where were you ? 
get out ... 
I think you had better leave 
well , what do you think ? 
yes - but you live here too - If it were your house ? 
what's wrong with you ? 
what ? 
you don't own him you know - you can't tell me not to see him ! 
I want you out now 
what happened ? 
is Leslie here ? 
it doesn't mention' females only' 
oh - Tell me Ellen , I can call you Ellen ? 
I lost the touch 
do you take sugar ? 
I'm sorry ? 
it says in the contract I can have a lock fitted - is there a problem Angela ? 
yes - I'm sorry Ellen ... 
if you want any - there's some left in the kitchen 
sugar ? 
so what do you do ? 
and how long have you been a dentist ? 
and how many people have you killed ? 
you don't know ? 
where do you kill them ... 
my car I stopped working from my car . she could have stopped me you know - If she really wanted too . that is the difference between the confusion of humanity and the purity of the beast - If a dog attacked you - you could easily kill it without any damage to yourself - Why then do people get bitten by dogs - savaged ? why ? 
because a dog will attack with a ferocity and force that we poses , but centuries of social contamination has run it out of us - that is what sets us aside from the purity of the beasts ... Society is rotting - men who once were strong and kept everything working are getting soft - women are making them soft - by the time a pretty girl has reached twenty - she has had three lifetimes worth of fun and attention- so she doesn't deserve any more - 
no she didn't ... 
you know everyone accuses me of being sick - the press , the TV - but I'm not you know - they are - I don't watch it for entertainment every night - I don't sit and watch it whilst eating my dinner - they all say , how could he cut her up ? she was dead - I can't hurt something dead - And all this whilst they slobber down their processed beef burgers by the dozen - I couldn't eat one of those burgers , you don't know what has gone in them ! 
I don't want to talk about it - 
I don't know ... 
I don't know ... 
let me ask you , why do you wear black Ellen Carter ? what are you running from ? 
why should I feel sorry - they're dead . 
I have something I have to show you ... 
my wife My wife was the only one who really deserved it . Leslie do this . Leslie do that . Leslie it's your fault ... She used to tell me what to wear , where to go , what to do - she mothered me ... 
it seemed like a good idea at the time - why did you marry your husband . 
you are the first person I have ever told any of this to . we are birds of a feather Ellen ... we're in the same league 
you've killed but you're not a killer 
why should I ? 
and how did it feel to be rid of him 
my mother ... ? I never knew my real MOTHER - I was adopted 
no ... I didn't do it ... I wish I had but I didn't . I was beaten to it . Stephanie became my mother . 
my sister - My adopted sister - 
Stephanie loved me - she got some insurance money and took legal custody of me - she was just old enough . we had a ball for years - we could do anything , anywhere , anyhow ... And we did ... We would play games - she would be the executioner and I would be the convict - She would strap me into the arm chair and pretend to electrocute me ... 
what ? 
psychiatrists would say that you are confronting your demons 
what's wrong ? 
what's wrong ? 
what is it ? 
you want me to wear white for you ? you must be madder than I thought ... 
where are you going ? 
we've got nothing to talk about 
I thought we had a relationship built on trust - and you just slap me in the face ... 
Leslie ? is that good enough ? 
Ellen , would you like a cup - there's plenty in the pot 
first finish your tea ... 
why did you let him in ? 
I don't like sugar 
it's not that - I just don't want any sugar 
I haven't been using it recently Leslie 
whats wrong ... what have I done wrong ? 
I loved you Ellen - why did you do this ? 
don't you want me now Leslie 
you see , I am writing this article for chic magazine 
when could I look round ? 
that's very kind of you Mr GRIFFITHS ... ? 
its cramped in here isn't it Brian 
tell me Brian , what would happen if the client lost the key ? 
so there is only one key ... 
and it can't be forged ? 
yes , I'm sure you could - but I can't risk you loosing your job 
all the time ? 
hello Mrs STECKLER - we haven't seen you for a long time 
I shouldn't say this - but you really remind me of someone I know 
I wasn't a manager here then Mrs STECKLER - don't you remember ? 
this must be one of the old keys - 
which do you think is her best shot ... 
don't give me shit - what do you want ? 
that's not technically accurate - SIMPSONS murders weren't sexually motivated . 
I heard something like that 
oh MY GAWD ! 
I thought you were someone else 
I thought someone was following me - I - er - I just needed my computer and some things ... Listen , I'd like to work from home for a few weeks - is that OK ? 
sounds good - thank you 
we'd better get to work on the papers . 
standard for a Mayfair marriage . Rowan - there is a codicil concerning the Mayfair assets . they must be ... aahhh ... held separate from the other party ... Michael that is it's in the will - for centuries . tradition enjoins , Rowan. of course , future earnings from your practice will not fall into - 
that's new territory for us ... but yes , we can look into that . explore shelter possibilities , funding bodies. we could - 
that would mean liquidating sizable amounts of cash . 
Rowan Mayfair . 
I thought you were almost engaged , Stu ... ? 
he's got great hands . 
I thought it was' whistle while you work . 
Mikey - pregnant women get crazy you know that . I mean - hell , they're all crazy anyway - right ... ? 
sooner Or later you're gonna run out of things to change . you always do . 
go home , Stu I'll call you . 
on which planet ... ? 
well , Normie - you won't have to worry about this one being finished for a lonnnnng time . how are the hands ... ? 
&apos; leave bees be - and the bees be nice .' didn't your father ever teach you that ... ? 
wow ... 
I'm getting --- left behind . 
a few hours and I'll be wasting away in Margaritaville . oh , sweet decadance . 
I'm glad you're around to say it . 
do they keep everything' out' ... ? 
what do you see ... ? 
just one . the bar's closed . 
you know - doors and keyholes are common signposts in out-of-body - 
harder ... 
harder ! 
you're very --- different . 
what else did you see- Michael ... ? 
my uncle . Graham . he and my Aunt , Ellie raised me . he - he - had a stroke- Just before Ellie died - of cancer . last year . 
it's unbelievable that you can do that . 
my mother and I used to take long walks and make up stories about the houses and the people who lived inside . the Queen's house-. the gangster's house-. the clown's house- Like that . 
oh . the Green underwater Ghost's ... The Man With The Eyes In His hands ... 
I was born , in New Orleans , too- 
Nope- My father died before I was born . my mother died in childbirth . El1ie was my only blood relation. so she brought me here ... the day after I was born . 
he's very pleased with your response to the surroundings . 
you touched him --- and saw him ... ? what was he doinging . kinky ... ? 
Ms. yin , and Mr. yang Aha ! 
why don't you let at do that ... ? 
doctor's orders- - - ? 
all I meant was - 
Christ , Michael - what the hell are we doing ... ? we don't even know - 
I'm serious . you don't - 
stop it . 
seems more like a year than a month . 
I called Dr. Styles at the neurological Institute In L.A. , remember ... ? he said he'd see you . he was intrigned . 
Michael , do you want to wear those for the rest of your life ... ? 
hello ... ? 
Rowan ... ? 
what's wrong .. ? 
what about you coming down here ... ? 
wait a minute . Rowan - what is going on ... ? 
you know ... ? 
she - she said I - I was a --- 
it could've been a tornado - or a - a hurricane . maybe - 
Ro - you can't really believe that . nobody can murder someone with their feelings . I mean --- that's CRAZY . 
c'mon . let's go to the ho--- 
even if it's all true - that doesn't make you a witch ! it's 1992 , Rowan ! 
stop looking at me like that ! I'm not some siren chanting to the moon . and my life is not a cosmic whim ! I am in charge of my life - - and I want to stay . everything that was taken from me is here , Michael . all these years , she was there without me . helpless . I should have been here . 
yes . I love you . very much . 
it'd take mounths ... and cost a fortune . 
what about your work back home ... ? 
I'll bet she had a wonderful smile . 
you sure ... ? 
everyone - this is Michael curry . 
I'm wondering why the hell he hasn't shown up . 
maybe he's just - waiting ... 
Ro , how long have we known each other . 
either do I. I love you , Ro . you know that . you're a total mystery to me - but I love YOU . 
you're a ve-ry bad witch , you know that ... ? 
smoking is bad for your heart , Michael . 
you're just afraid I'll drop dead before I finish the damn house . 
I took off my gloves today - with Aaron - - and it was okay . 
aren't we supposed to love somebody for their moral rectitude or their courage or their beneficence - 
so how come I love you most when you stick your finger in your chin ... ? 
a little wine ... ? 
dropped it . 
maybe the shrimp you bad last night . 
gee - look at that . I didn't know alligators came this far up on shore 
nobody makes a car like them Nasis ... 
no . this is unreal ... 
fall in New Orleans ... This whole town is waterlogged ! the matches , the wood , my clothes , my skin . 
Rowan we're below sea level . I've spent time there myself . 
you did that , didn't you ... ? 
remember the first time we made love - and then --- 
your beneficence . 
you alright ... ? 
is he - is he gonna die ... ? 
Michael - why would he want to hurt Stu ... ? 
a bit much . Lucas . 
when aid you get home last night ... ? 
Dovetails . gotta be a hundred years old . 
something's wrong with you . 
hi . 
I - I ... I can't , Michael . there's stuff --- at the clinic - 
you've gone away from me , Ro ... someplace I don't know how to get to . 
I can't . 
I can't leave now . don't ask me to explain ! I just can't ! 
Michael - please - just. a little longer . don't leave . 
stop it ! 
you could kill me - right now , couldn't you ... ? couldn't you ... ? ! tell me the truth --- is it Lasher ... ? answer me ! ! 
Lasher ... Where --- where is --- 
harder ... 
harder ... 
Yessss ... 
put - him - down ! his - his heart ... 
let me go ... Michaelllllll ... 
I'll destroy you . I swear it ! if you don't kill me , I'll find a - 
I am your son . I would not wound you . I could not - ever . 
you do not love Michael How can you love - if you lie ... ? 
yes , Michael . Harder-- . more ... 
I am with you , my love . like no other can ever be . 
stop ! 
the wasps were meant for Michael - but there's only so much you can control , isn't there ? the great and powerful lasher - undone by a faulty ladder- .. Why would you hurt him ... ? ! answer me . 
you violated ME ! ! ! on MY wedding NIGHT ! 
made it ... ? 
to love , you must be able to feel . 
if I could feel like you feel ... but I have only others' feelings - . . like breeres that blow through me . things to be felt , yes --- but not nine to feel ... 
 
I'm going to have a baby . Michael wants to name it after you - if it's a girl . Diedre Mayfair Curry . pretty , huh ... ? funny --- I never really thought I'd ever --- 
there is no one here but the dead . 
if that were true , I would not be here . 
you crave what I might show you . what you can learn . what I can give you . so much more than Michael can . 
but I could understand . I want to understand ! 
do not tell me that ! 
I know that you're evil . 
and now you expect me to stockpile corpses for you ... ? ! 
--- and I have heard you from the beginning ... from it's very first beat . 
then help me--- for his sake ... 
focus all your powers on me , Rowan until it is done . only me ... 
leave me alone ! 
wrong ... ? science is not magic . 
you went into the cells --- and you changed them . how ... ? ! 
I don't know what you are ! ! ! 
no ! 
Aaron was in the dream . a dream tilled with spirits. you killed him , didn't you ... ? 
the portraits , Lasher . why are the witches always before a door ... ? tell me , Lasher . now ! 
oh god ... 
Rowan and I will be together now . my time has come . your time is gone . 
parents say he - uh - fell - 
- and he seemed okay . just banged his - 
uh - then he - be just - 
massive subdural hamatoma . we have to evacuat it - right now . 
mum ... Oh Mum , God will surely strike us - 
go back , Michael ... Go Back 
help us . do what you can . 
hello ... ? who is this ... ? 
Rowan Mayfair . who's calling ... ? 
I beg your par--- 
who is this ... ? 
I don't have any aunts - and I've never heard of a' Carlotta' - or , for that matter - a' Diedre' ! just who - 
my ... mother ... ? 
but my mother ... Ellie said she died - 
-Ellie said she died when I was BORN ! she's been alive ... ? all THIS TIME ... ? why have I been lied to when - 
who the hel1 - 
what's the matter with you ... ? ! what kind of person are you ... ? ! 
when is the funeral ... ? I am coming to my mother's funeral ! ! 
I'm coming down there ! ! and it you put my mother in the ground betore I arrive , you'll wish you'd never seen my face ! is THAT understood ... ? ! 
I want to see my mother . where is she ... ? 
she was alive all these years ... You NEVER let me know her . who gave you that right ... ? ! 
I might as well be Rowan Smith - or Jones ! you cut me off from every - 
I don't want the - 
eighty million doll --- ? 
the lamplight . that's all . 
better than most , I suppose . 
you kept her in this filth in restraints ... ? . 
you're a monster . 
why are you doing this ... ? handing out these horrors ! why ... ? ! ! 
he's shown himself to you ... on the deck . in the storm . 
Lasher touched you and you loved it . 
just like your mother - and all the others that felt him - and used his power - and went to hell with a smile ! 
witches . Rowan. that is what we are . 
and that is why I pushed your grandmother onto the stones - even as she had him inside her ... 
... and why I put thirty years between you and the beautiful monster . to kill the legacy ! you are the sum of his desires - 
did you like it ... ? looking down at Graham and knowing what you could do ... ? 
down here. darling , we figure : if you're taking a trip to God knows where - might as well have one hell of a going-away party . 
I'm not saying I believe it ... but I heard it' nough times to know somebody did . they made a deal with the devil . y'know - " make us rich " - worship the number thirteen - the whole bit . and some stuff about' bringing them all back through a door ...' 
I want to see my mother . 
he made that quite clear , yes . 
aren't they gauche ... ? those steel things are so - common . 
you two sees like a perfect fit . only two mounths ... ? 
always give the crovd a taste , darling . now - Ryan said I'm supposed to make sure - 
&apos; the heir to the fortune must wear the Mayfair pendant an her wedding day .' we should all have to suffer such burdens . 
I'm sure he's alright , Bea . they'll find him somewhere . 
Jesus I've got - to get to the ho-- 
with her family . Rowan's mother died yesterday . 
I ask only that you stay here , long enough to be - educated . a few hours . 
a what ... ? 
there is a difference between sensing danger - and being afraid. what defines you in the landscape , Michael ... ? what anchors your life ... ? your work ... ? your creativity ... ? 
then focus on how you feel about her . because your feelings define you . take off your gloves , Michael . 
Michael , Rowan should - 
what have the witches always asked of you ... ? 
on't know what else to do . maybe I just don't belong in her life. well - I'm already out of her life . 
I'll probably be back in a week ... but I can't spend Christmas in that house. you'll check on her - every day ... ? 
Aaron - lieten to me ... It's been Lasher - from the start ! 
Rowan ... 
then what is he ... ? 
going away doesn't mean you leave Lasher behind . he was on Rowan's deck - and the plane ... geography seems irrelevant now . 
thank you for this honor , my dear . 
I've grown very fond of you you and Michael both . 
Lasher will act , Rowan . whatever it is he wants - he's waited three hundred years to have it. facing him alone ... I don't like - 
are you alright ... ? you look pale . 
there are two . 
with his hands ! 
you've always said you felt goodness in them - that the witches brought you and Rowan together . isn't that right ... ? they're reaching out to you , Rowan ! 
: what , you're doing Darcy ? since when ? 
: would you stop it ! 
: what do you mean " They " are ? are you officially a woman now ? 
Christ , that's twice in ... When did they move in ? 
three weeks . 
Feur , I think . psych department . figures . they're all psychotic . 
when's she out of here ? 
alright . I can't take the rejection . I'm going to class . 
Claire , I have to show up for the-- 
it's today ? 
Claire ? 
whatcha reading ? 
how is it ? 
nice . almost done . 
fine . 
I am , really . 
not the focus . 
to tell you the truth ... I'm excited . 
to get my life back . to have some time for myself . some time for us . 
we did . 
I know . 
Nope . 
Yup . 
and we moved out here for the quiet . 
maybe we should just ... 
I'm finished at three . no . squash with Stan . 
of him I think . 
more or less . 
I'm telling you . there was something in her voice ... 
not like this . we were never like this . I want to go over there . after dinner , we can-- 
to make sure she's all right . 
that's not what I'm sug-- 
but what if something happens ? 
I'd never be able to live with mysel-- 
I know . 
I just wish you could have heard her . 
Mmnph . 
nothing . there was ... I thought I saw something . 
hi . 
oh . 
Claire ? 
what are you doing here ? 
what do you mean ? some noises where ? 
did you call the police ? 
of course . 
what kind of whispering ? 
I've got the conference next week . I want you to feel safe . 
think I may have cracked it . 
I think so . maybe . 
yep . 
you're kidding . 
wow . 
well , that's nice . 
oh , no ... 
that's ... 
I'm so sorry . 
that's just mean . oh . Jody wanted to know if I could get her some . 
what ? no . no . 
sorry . you understand . 
oh , right . yes . Harvey says the guy's a sweetheart . wouldn't hurt a fly . 
get down ! he'll see . 
he killed her . 
he did . she's in the picture . I went over to look and she's gone . the table was set for one . 
our house . 
it's a flare . 
from the sun . it's a reflection on the glass . 
where is she then ? 
what am I looking at ? 
who did ? Mrs. Feur ? 
she was lonely , I talked to her . Norman , I know how it looks , but-- 
dressed ? 
when ? 
oh . 
tonight ? 
when you do this , I swear ... 
... like it never even happened ... 
what are you doing ? 
we're going to be fine . 
Harvey says he's amazing . 
Claire , she's been a huge part of your life for seventeen years . if you weren't thrown off balance by this , then something would be wrong . 
I never said ... 
are you lonely ? 
what are you doing out here ? 
this is the Feur thing ? 
how do you know this ? 
Jody and I. And she was there , Norman , she was . it scared Jody so bad she had to leave . 
what ? 
what are you ... ? no . 
sabotage ? 
the accident ... ? 
Norman , this isn't about you . this is something that's happening to me . it's not to get even ... and it's not some warped bid for attention . some strange things are happening in our house , whether you believe in them or not ... 
keep your voice down . 
... I'm pulling up , Yuri . I'll see you for dinner . sure you won't stay ? 
yep . 
what ? 
you know I am . 
you were lost in the music ... eyes closed ... your chest heaving ... 
you don't remember ? 
you dropped a glass . 
in the living room ... 
but why ? I can't understand how I could just completely-- 
but I don't remember . 
I may have seen her on campus . 
no . I'm afraid to ask what this is about . 
the ... 
I thought it was Mrs. Feur , but it's not ... 
... I'm positive this time ... 
it's Madison Fra-- 
I take it your not mad at me . 
OW ! 
it's too rough . 
I don't like this , this ... 
I think she's starting to suspect something . 
your wife ... 
" you know ... " 
I was there . 
I came to work in the garden and I saw you with her ... in my house . 
it was last year . we were having troubles . 
that's not what I'm sayi-- 
Claire , please don't ... 
I never asked you to quit ! 
that'S NOT true ! you wanted to quit ! and then when you did , you hated me for it ... so you gave it all to her . 
to Caitlin ! ! 
and then out of nowhere , some bright young woman found me attractive ... 
... would do anything just to be around me . and I slipped . God help me , I slipped . 
I tried to break it off ! 
Claire ... 
she was damaged and unstable . the more I tried to distance myself , the more desperate she became . finally , she showed up at the new house ... 
she did it . 
of course she did , Norman . what else could it be ? 
it's alright . 
she's gone . 
she can't be here without me . 
I don't know , but I am . she was there and then she was gone . I felt it . 
the leaves ... 
look for antiques ... 
what ? 
huh . 
don't think so . 
what's that for ? 
I'm cooking you dinner . 
I know . 
she's out there isn't she ? she's in the lake . 
don't I , Norman ? you kept THE FUCKING necklace . of a woman you killed ! 
I don't believe you . 
Mmmuh ... 
Mauduh ... 
how you holding up ? 
you are ? 
cause ... your ... only daughter just went away to school ... who you were incredibly close with aaand I'd be tripping ... 
well good . so you're human . 
wow . got here just in time . I brought you this . 
Kambucha mushroom tea ... 
it soothes heart-ache and promotes psychic wellness . Sela suggested I bring-- 
she's not a psychic . just a very enlightened spirit . 
so you'll have some later . notice anything ... different ? 
yep . 
beautiful thing , alimony . lose a husband , get a car . think it'll help me pick up dudes ? 
listen , I've gotta run . I just thought I'd stop by and see if you want to take the boat out , say Thursday morning ? 
you think he killed her ? 
know what I think ? 
Seance . 
telling you ... 
just bought this beautiful antique ouija . 
someone's there . 
in the window . Norman's at work . 
wow . I'm losing it . 
sit down here . 
place your fingers on the planchette . 
we wish to commune with the spirit of Mrs. Feur . what's her first name ? 
nothing's happening . 
oh ... 
Mef ? what's Mef ? 
I have to go . 
are you okay ? 
I'm sorry for leaving , but I mean , Jesus , Claire ... 
Jody , she's alive . 
Mrs. Feur . she's alive . I met her . she's really sweet . 
nothing . it wasn't anything . I've been on edge lately . maybe since the accident . and I'd prefer , I really would , to just-- 
did I ? 
Hartford ? 
no . Jody , listen to me . you have to listen to me . this is not something that I can do right now . whatever it was , it's gone . I need it to be gone now . 
please . 
oh God ... you knew . 
adamant ? 
I started to walk over ... but he wasn't alone . a blond . I only caught a glimpse . she was young . I should have said something right away . but I didn't . 
partly because I didn't want to hurt you ... but partly ... partly because I was relieved . 
too late ? Jody , it was an accident . 
I got there first . Stan covered up the pills and I had it out with Norman . he seemed desperate not to lose you . he promised to handle it . and we all let it drop away . 
I'm a terrible friend . 
how could I expect you to tell me something that I wouldn't even tell myself ? 
I don't know . 
she could have hurt me if she wanted to . 
Jody , she tried to kill him . 
I can't believe this is happening . 
that could take days . I need to do something now . don't you see ? she wants us dead . 
like what ? 
but he acted like he'd never heard of it . 
what if he was ? do you think he wanted to bring that up again just when you're trying to make a new start ? 
I don't know ... 
wow . 
he looked like one of the Monkees . 
I didn't sleep with him . 
I came in from my room ... 
and there's this brilliant conductor in purple briefs with no bangs cursing his ass off in Finnish . 
you should have heard her play . 
we both auditioned for the Philharmonic . one cello position open . 
and I kicked ass . my best stuff . then I stood in the hallway and listened to her audition ... and I cried . 
she got it . turned it down . 
Mrs. Frank ? 
I'd like to talk to you about Madison . 
what's your name ? 
just plain old coffee . none of that mocha nonsense . 
you look a little old for a student . 
sounds about right . never understood how a girl that wild got all A's . sure didn't get it from me . they wanted to put her in a special school for the gifted when she was young . Maddie wouldn't hear about it . 
why are you here ? 
full scholarships . Princeton too . she wanted to stay close . 
they're calling me in to work . 
y'hear anything you'll let me know ? 
what was her major ? 
who are you ? 
you're the flower lady . 
I've seen you . from the window . 
hello ? 
he's so ... it's too much ... and I can't ... I can't breath ... 
and I'm afraid . oh god , I'm so afraid of ... 
I can't , no , no , I can't ... 
that I'll just ... that one day I'll just ... disappear . 
how ? how can you help me ? with your flowers and your perfect life ... 
I've never even met you . 
this fence ... it's so ... 
oh God . he's back . I'm sorry . please forget that I ... I don't know what I'm saying . please ... 
I wanted to apologize . 
for scaring you like I did . when I thought about what that must have seemed like that day ... 
right . I'm sorry . 
no . 
love . 
um ... sure . 
you must think I'm pathetic . 
I'm sorry that I frightened you like that . but I was so touched by your concern . I've been lonely here . perhaps we could be friends . 
um ... 
right . well , I wanted to stop by to welcome you to the uh , to the neighborhood . I'm Claire Spencer . from next door . 
she isn't here . 
I don't know . 
who ? 
of course . you must be so proud . 
how're you holding up ? 
Norman was telling me the dream house is finally finished . 
I'm sorry ? 
Uh-huh . what can be ? 
for the Dupont Chair . I swear . I'm becoming the nosy old lady I used to run from at Amherst . 
there was just ... some tension . you were upset . I remember being concerned . 
toward the end . you remember ? 
well , I'm glad . pardon my intrusiveness , but we do have to stick together you know . 
who's idea was it ? 
I didn't want to come . 
because he was worried about me . 
yes . I'm sure he's hoping you'll pack me full of prozac so he can live out his life in peace . 
no . 
because , I don't know , because sometimes ... sometimes I forget things ... and ever since Caitlin left , ever since my daughter left for school , there've been ... I fainted and ... Why is this so hard ? 
these are good . 
she finished my solitaire game and turned on the radio ... she likes rock and roll . angry rock and roll . 
I saw her in the water . beside me . she was filling the bathtub . 
pretty . she's a blond . 
um ... I'd rather not say ... just yet . 
what ? 
you think that'll help ? 
are you humoring me ? 
how ? 
what's happening to me ? 
whether you imagined it or not , you actually saw and heard things that frightened you ... that gave you reason for concern . 
your friend saw them . 
maybe . I don't know . I just know that when all this was happening , I felt , some part of me felt ... alive . like somebody needed me . and the more I reached out to , it , the Fuller it became . 
she said , " You know . " that I know . 
no . 
I felt ... pain . that she'd been hurt by someone . this is great . I'm trying to intuit the emotions of a figment of my-- 
me ? no . well , in the accident I was injured , but ... 
what ? 
that can't feel good . 
hey . 
it's only two hours away . 
I'll come back all the time . 
that was very good . 
besides , Dad would have freaked . 
I think playing in a band called " Bitch " might put a dent in the whole " perfect family " thing . 
yes it is . can we please not do that ? please ? cause it is . 
so much . 
what do you mean ? 
a ghost ? 
no . but once I heard ... 
someone crying . a girl . I thought I was crazy . 
stop saying things so loud ! 
save it for the powder room babe , this man is in pain 
you bet . we all can't be such modern people 
looks a little spooky boys , you think we should do this ? 
Mom . 
they're all human beings 
oh really ? we're they' us'es' or' them's' ? 
Mom , when are you going to let me have some coffee in the morning ? 
but mom , I NEED THE CAFFINE - badly 
sir Wilfred , this is Sarah Brighton . this is Sir Wilfred . 
no thank you sir we're fine . 
well ? 
if you sold your soul to the devil , you'd never age either 
maybe before the event , never after . 
guys , if I'm going to play the hero at least give me a little room . 
this time I really don't see anyone man . 
haven't we been doing our homework . 
getting scared ? don't worry , they've probably just gone home . 
Wooo . jealously rearing its ugly head . 
then why do you still like her ? 
I don't know . I really like you and I think you're very attractive . 
no I'm serious . it's. it's just I don't know I. I'm looking for something else . 
that's not what you said last night . 
listen Sarah , I think I know what's going on ok . I went to the waxwork today.I met this man . 
you don't understand . I recognized his face now come on . 
well ? 
well , it all started when a friend and I 
Sarah listen to me . 
Velcome to ve Vaxverk . 
I hope you enjoyed your visit .

your books Master Loftmore 
and your coff - excuse me , caffeine sir 
and uh , your nicotine sir

we're all here , and ready sir ! 
Jenkins . can I get you some help ?

yeah well why should I suffer for that ? 
OK toots , I will . 
China . what happened ? China Shhh . it's ok . I missed you so much . 
with Mark ? 
oh I don't give a shit the guy's a slob . he doesn't even know how to spell' lady' let alone treat me like one . you know the last time we went out he actually made me pay for a drink ? 
yes , I'm sure . what I need is an older man , something with class , a little style . someone who knows how to treat a lady . 
businessman ! 
yeah 
but ? 
what's that ? 
with all due respect , Mr. Gekko , what's to prevent you from doing the same thing ? 
are you prepared to put that in writing ? 
cards are on the table . what do you think ? 
we know what you're up to , Gekko , and let me tell you this from here , you suck eggs , mister , over my dead body you ain't gonna break up Bluestar . 
listen , you clowns , there's somebody else out there trying to buy your airline , if you want to be Pac-manned and gobbled by Atilla the Hun be my guest ! 
rarest pistol in the world , Larry , a .45 Luger . only six were ever manufactured . 
the same interest as yours Larry . money . I thought it'd be a good investment for my kid ... 
considering you brought my mother into it , $ 71.50 . 
yeah , Billy , who's your buyer ? ... No , not interested . Ollie , start calling a the institutions , start with Marx at Janson Mutual , then Reardon . get me that California retirement money , baby ! and we're on our way ! 
he respond to the offer ? what ? what the hell's Cromwell doing giving lecture tours when his company's losing 60 million a quarter ? I guess he's giving lectures on how to lose money ... if this guy opened a funeral parlor , no one would die , this turkey's totally brain dead ... Well Christmas is over and business is business . keep buying . dilute the sonofabitch . Ollie I want every orifice in his body flowing red . 
hey , the Terminator ! blow' em away Ollie . 
what do you say we go get a suite at the Carlyle ? caviar ? champagne ? celebrate , just like the old times Sunshine . 
it's not puppy love , Gordon . anyway , Buddy and I are splitting up . 
it's over you , Gordon . 
now tell me , why would I want to do that ? 
don't worry Sunshine . Bud and I had a little talk . we came to an understanding . I want you to go back to him . soothe him . help keep his head straight . okay ? 
come on , we both like Buddy . but this bleeding heart puppy love act is over the top ... It doesn't fit . 
you and I are the same , Darien . we're smart enough not to buy into the oldest myth running : love ... A fiction created by people who got nothing to keep them from jumping out of windows . 
I thought this was an informal meeting . what's he doing here ? 
frankly , Carl , I can't see giving much more . if you have any suggestions I'll be glad to listen . 
I beg your pardon . is that a proverb ? 
fine , if you don't want us , stay with the scum in present management--dedicated to running you and Bluestar into the ground . 
you got a look in your eye , Mr. Mannheim ... You got something for the small fry ... 
sleep with me and the secrets of the West are yours . 
no such thing Bud -' cept death and taxes . not a good company anymore , no fundamentals . what's going on Bud ? do you know something ? remember there're no short cuts son , quick buck artists come and go with every bull market but the steady players make it through the bear markets . you're part of something here , Bud . the money you make for people creates science and research jobs . don't sell that out . 
can't get a little bit pregnant , Bud . 
you're on a roll kiddo . enjoy it while it lasts --' cause it never does . 
how you doing Buddy ? 
morning Buddy , you look happy . 
you were never that innocent sugarpie . 
Bud ! where you been the last two days ? 
he had a heart attack , hon , but he's okay , he's at the hospital ... 
hello again , I been holding these drinks for us for the last three weeks . 
grand Marnier . a romantic and tragic drink . 
destiny took us apart , but I knew it would bring us back together . 
stock broker . as in : never have so few done so little for so much . so what do you see in this ? 
... few thousand dollars down the drain if you ask me . 
you could have a great beach house for that . 
boy , I thought Gordon was a tough businessman , but somebody's really taking him to the cleaners here . 
I gather you're a decorator . 
well , if you're that good , you could probably do wonders at my place . 
upper West Side . 
oh it's just a rental . I'm moving to the East Side soon . I've got a couple of deals brewing with Gordon. but that's just conversation ... what about real things ? like dinner . the two of us . Friday . cafe . Santo Domingo . 
break it . 
you really do believe in destiny ? 
Devon ? he looks like Seattle slew . what about the triple Crown ? 
how would I know ? I once bet a horse . he went out at ten to one and came in at quarter to five . 
so , how did your conference go with Gordon ? 
you have modest wants . I like that in a man . 
... a Turner , a perfect canary diaiaond ... a Lear jet ... world peace ... the best of everything ... 
I don't . 
... isn't it perfect ! 
you know , the elevator man couldn't believe I paid $ 300,000 to have my walls looking like this , he's got them for free in Brooklyn . 
let's get things straight , Bud . I'm not going to take a cut . I worked hard and you can't decorate a room in New York for less than $ 100,000 . curtains alone ... 
you got it all charted out don't you , like a stock projection . 
do you think you're ready ? 
Bud , I hate to tell you this but you're a genius ! Darien ... lightning has struck ! the lightbulb has been invented . Edison , Da Vinci , Einstein are watching ... 
get in bed . y'ever hear of the sixty hour work week ? you're turning into a yuppie Frankenstein , you love money so much . 
you're so naive Bud , you don't even know . your dad took care of you . I might've been rich when I was a kid ... but my father lost all his money ... in the Seventies , in the stock market , at the track . he was a lousy gambler ... 
fear . the fear of being poor I guess , just like you , Darien ... But that's all gonna change sweetheart . I'm catching the express ... ... and you're going along for the ride . 
talk about being bent over the sink of life and being dry humped . I handed it to him on a silver platter . I told my father and those people ... 
I'm not gonna let it happen Darien . 
at least I wouldn't be pulling the trigger . 
I can stay with the brokerage firm . and you're doing fine . we can survive without Gordon Gekko . 
you really mean that ? what'd he promise you ? to take you public ? I guess without Gordon's money and seal of approval , I'm not such a hot investment anymore . you're just the best money can buy , Darien ... 
you may not believe this Bud but I really do care for you . I think we could've made a good team ... but that's how it goes ... 
hi . 
how do you do Mr. Gekko . I'm Bud Fox . 
so what s on your mind kimosabe ? why am I listening to you ? got to monitor my blood pressure , so whatever you do , don't upset me . 
within 45 seconds , a microprocessor computes your systolic and diastolic pressure . has an LCD readout , and it's cost effective -- less than one visit to the doctor . 
so what firm you with , pal ? 
... Yeah , and we're working on some other interesting stuff . 
can't tell you that , Mr. Gekko . 
chart break-out on this one here ... uh Whitewood-Young Industries ... low P.E. explosive earnings . 30 % discount from book . great cash flow . coupla 5 % holders . strong management . 
... rings a bell somewhere . so what ? 
... don't like airlines , lousy unions ... 
how do you know ? 
my home number's on the back ... 
hi sport . 
see this ? can you believe it ? two inch screen ... 
... for my kid Rudy -- 3 years old , electronics freak , got a liquid crystal display' stead of an electronic beam . we're going into a new age pal . so how's business today . 
Teldar's shooting up . buy any for yourself ? bet you were on the phone two minutes after you got out of my office . 
Mr. Gekko -- thank you for the chance . you won't regret this , you're with a winner . 
excuse me sir . 
Mr. Gekko , I don't think I can ... go on . 
nice club , Mr. Gekko ... 
uh , Mr. Gekko , we took a little loss today . we got stopped out on Tarafly ... ... about 50 thousand . 
what ? how do you know about my father ? 
know the name ? 
sir Larry Wildman . like all Brits he thinks he was born with a better pot to piss in ... bribed an old secretary of mine to open bar mouth and stole RDL pharmaceuticals right out from under me . Wildman the white knight . 
revenge is a dish best served cold ... well , it's payback time , sport . ... see that building ? I bought into it ten years ago . it was my first real estate deal . I sold it a couple of years later and made an $ 800,000 dollar profit . it was better than sex . at that time I thought that was all tne money in the world ... Now , it's a day's pay ... I had a mole in Wildman's employ . gave me half the picture , then he got fired ... 
Wildman's in town . he just became an American citizen . something big's about to go down . I want to know where he goes and who he sees . I want you , sport , to give me the missing half of the picture ... 
inside information . oh you mean like when a father tells his son about a court ruling on an airline ? or someone overhears me saying I'm gonna buy Teldar Paper ? or the chairman of the board of XYZ suddenly knows it's time to blow out XYZ . you mean that ? I'm afraid sport , unless you got a father on the board of directors of another company , you and I are gonna have a hard time doing any business ... 
I got all I could get which was 750,000 shares plus 5000 March 50 calls . average price of $ 47 a share And $ 4 per contract for the call . I just wish I could've got more . 
... we have 37.2 million invested . at this point , we're up 3.1 million and some change . if it goes to 75 bucks we can clean close to 12 mill . 
my firm needs your signature on these option agreements tonight , sir , otherwise we could take a real bath tomorrow . 
sorry , Mr. Gekko . 
I guess I'll head back ... 
the break up value is higher . it's worth 80 . 
" all warfare is based on deception ... " Sun Tzu says , If your enemy is superior , evade him , if angry , irritate him , if equally matched , fight ... if not , split and reevaluate . 
money never sleeps pal . when I came in in' 69 , they traded six hours a day , now the clock don't stop , London's deregulated , the Orient is hungrier than us . just let the money circle the world , sport , buying and selling , and if you're smart it comes back paying . I just made $ 800,000 in Hong Kong gold . it's been wired to you -- play with it . you done good , but you gotta keep doing good . I showed you how the game works , now school's out . 
you don't understand . I want to be surprised ... astonish me , sport , new info , don't care where or how you get it , just get it ... My wife tells me you put a move on Darien . here's some inside info for you . that Euroflash GQ guy she's going with's got big bucks but he's putting her feet to sleep . exit visas are imminent . so don't lose your place in line . oh , jeez , I wish you could see this . the lights coming up over the water . I've never seen a painting that captures the beauty of the ocean at this moment . ... an old Russian proverb - " a fisherman always sees another fisherman from afar . " I like you sport , I ever tell you that ... Gordon , call me Gordon from now on . 
got him at an auction in Kentucky . 
mixed emotions , Buddy : like Larry Wildman going off a Cliff in my new Maserati . men as smart as myself have got their asses handed to them on a sling with the airlines , fuel could go up , unions are killers ... 
Gordon what I want--and I never asked you for anything--is to be your co-pilot on this . I want to take this airline , turn it around , and make it work . it's gonna make us a fortune ! 
Gordon , I worked at Bluestar , I know my way around , I have friends there ... inside . 
the three unions . it's 43 % of Bluestar's operating budget , the hourly cost of a flight crew is $ 850 an hour , that's the real hidden value G.G. , if you can negotiate that out , get a crew down to $ 350-400 an hour a run , this airline is gonna be the hottest thing since Texas Air ... 
I can talk to these people Gordon , they trust me ... and my father can be a big help in getting cuts . 
and I'd like to introduce you to Mr. Gekko , and his lawyer , Mr. Salt . 
now , wait a minute , Dad ... 
I didn't know we had a meeting schedule for this morning . 
what the hell do you want ? 
maybe you ought to read him Pinocchio . you told me you were going to turn Bluestar around . not upside down . you used me . 
why do you need to wreck this company ? 
if these people lose their jobs , nowhere to go . my father worked at Bluestar for twenty-four years . I gave' em my word . 
tell me , Gordon--when does it all end ? how many yachts can you waterski behind ? how much is enough ? 
how much is enough Gordon ? 
obviously ... 
... I can't make it tonight . 
Gordon , it's two minutes to close . what do you want to do ? ! decide . 
hello Bud . 
Fox , Bud D. is this deja vu or has it really been a year . you're not hitting me up for NYU are you ? 
can't complain . got a house in oyster Bay . market treating you good ? still seeing that sexy French gal ? 
what was that ? 
so , does " this guy " have a tip for an honest lawyer ? 
okay . 
come on Buddy , you wouldn't want to got me disbarred now would you ? 
yeah , right ... 
... and if I did , what's in it for moi ? 
too much to do ... but I'll walk you out . 
so what's the problem ? 
.... Relax Roget You're 82M in the account numbers and I'm the Invisible Man ... they're always looking for red flags , Gekko's always getting checked by them , they never come up with anything ... we're invulnerable on this ... 
Gekko asked us into the Bluestar deal . we're reviewing the timetables , wanna come ? 
hello Bud , I'm Lisa , a friend of Gordon's . 
like ? uh ... hmmm . well ... 
so you're hot on this stock ? 
sure , and I'm never gonna die either , is this one of your chain letter schemes or do I gotta buy a door to door cosmetic franchise in Northern Arkansas ? 
... this guy who said he was from the Security Exchange Commission , whatever the hell that is , calls and wants to ask me about that stock I bought ... 
I told him I was in the bathroom and I'd call him right back . what the hell was I supposed to say Buddy , you got me into ... 
what if he asks where I got the money ? 
what if they call him ? 
you sure ? 
I don't know anything ! 
hello , Natalie , you recognize the voice ? I'll give you a hint , you're thinking seriously about marrying me ... 
... And you're even lovelier than I pictured . I brought a birthday present for Mr. Gekko . 
it's in the bible , see . you better go buy him a present . please , Natalie . let me give him the gift ; Cuban cigars--Davidoff , his favorite and hard to get . 
... thanks Natalie . 
... looks like you grown another inch ... but you don't look so hot , getting bags under your eyes , starting to look old like me . 
speak English will ya . 
I told you not to go into that racket . you could've been a doctor or a lawyer , 
you coulda stayed at Bluestar and been a supervisor in instead of going customer relations by now ,' stead of going off and bein' a salesman . 
you get on the phone and ask strangers for their money , right ? you're a salesman . 
I don't get it , you get a scholarship to NYU , you get 35,000 the first year , and 50 last year , where the hell is it ? 
so come home and live rent free ,' stead of that cockroach palace you live in . $ 50,000 Jesus Christ , the world is off its rocker . I made $ 37,000 last year and you ... 
it's yourself you've got to be proud of , Huckleberry , how much ya need ? 
... Got a 100 on me , you ... 
... it adds up Buddy , 300 here , 200 there . your brother never ... ... well , I always said money is something you need in case you don't die tomorrow ... 
... same , pain in the ass , god bless her , talks too much ... gonna take her to Florida next month ... west coast , near Tampa , like to get out for good , but can't afford it . 
... this drug testing is driving my guys nuts . I got flagged for my blood pressure pills . the only good news is , we just met with the comptroller over some union stuff ...' member that crash last summer ? and the investigation ? well , the FAA is gonna rule it was a manufacturing flaw in the door latch mechanism .

he , uh , has he been in the " jail " long ? 
... and ... 
look , look , look .... He's fine , as long as he has his medication . 
he's not fine . 
you know , I think you people are looking at this All Wrong . if you look at the &lt; u &gt; backstory &lt; / u &gt; -- the guy's coming back from Combat and Torture . of &lt; u &gt; course &lt; / u &gt; he is gonna be ... uh ... uh ... " fucked up " . of &lt; u &gt; Course &lt; / u &gt; he's gonna " need a little help " ... 
&lt; u &gt; IT destroyed THE electoral process &lt; / u &gt; . 
... where ? 
... his Triumphal plane . shot Down . 
you can't tell this story . he's not kidding you . you can't tell this story . &lt; u &gt; You &lt; / u &gt; knew that . the pay off was , you get to be Ambassador , or ... 
... how do we Explain That ? hey ? am I worried ... ? 
&lt; u &gt; Fuck &lt; / u &gt; the world . try a ten A.M. &lt; u &gt; pitch &lt; / u &gt; meeting , no sleep , coked-to-the-gills , and you haven't even read the &lt; u &gt; material &lt; / u &gt; . 
I'm concerned about the driver of the rig . 
Naa , fuck this , this is nothing . oh , Lord -- this just got &lt; u &gt; Big &lt; / u &gt; . I see it -- &lt; u &gt; Big &lt; / u &gt; -- Big for &lt; u &gt; you &lt; / u &gt; and big for &lt; u &gt; me &lt; / u &gt; . 
he's &lt; u &gt; dead &lt; / u &gt; . he's &lt; u &gt; dead &lt; / u &gt; . the fella killed Old shoe . 
you want some research , flu ? Side-effects of medi .... 
... tonight ... 
what if he's busy tonight ? 
what are you saying ... 
... on the way in . 
it's the White House . 
what about it ? 
to the first LETAC engineer to go into production on prototypes . 
as long as they keep overpaying me , I'll keep overpaying you . ) Just make goddam sure you can have 10 of them ready for deployment around the city by next month . 
do they have to look so ... robotic ? 
where's John ? 
the only thing I want to hear is your silence . 
you and me have nothing in common . 
you ... mother ... fucker ! I'M GOING TO KILL YOU ! ! ! 
Grimes , YOU'RE DEAD ! 
dead ! you HEAR ME ? 
I wouldn't pull the trigger if I were you — — 
what C-4 ... was Cox talking about ? 
let me put it to you this way ... whether I'm here ... or whether I'm not ... I'm leaving an indelible mark on the world tomorrow night . 
you can't die until you tell me where the C-4 is . where is it ? ! 
it's really too bad you have to miss the Grand Finale . 
there you go — — best seat in the house . 
let's just say I'm sending a very clear message to his re — election rally ... 
what are you talking about ? 
now , is that any way to talk to an old friend ? 
you actually listen to all those tapes ? 
a little less than yesterday . 
John died . 
that's not true , Parker . 
what was going through your mind when you killed the busboy ? 
you didn't see the expression you had on your face when you pulled the trigger . but I did . you kind of liked it , didn't you ? that thrill of going over the edge again . of taking out an innocent bystander or two , as long as you got the target ... 
it was just like before , wasn't it ? wasn't it ? but you are making progress . instead of killing seven people to get the one you're after , this time there was only one other person involved . 
I don't need a baby — sitter . 
it wasn't a lie . 
you all right ? 
you ready for this ? 
he was re — enacting Charles Manson's LaBianca murders . 
whoever did this wanted to do Charlie one better — — to improve upon what was already done . 
I've spent over 50 hours interviewing him . Charlie killed Leno and Rosemary LaBianca because of the ugly way the members of his family had butchered Sharon Tate . after seeing the blood bath on television , he wanted to show them how it should be done . the question is , what does Charlie have to do with Sid 6.7 ? 
learn anything from Lindenmeyer's file ? 
you've got a problem with me carrying a gun ? 
what are you doing ? 
you've studied me , now I'm studying you . seems only fair , don't you think ? 
I've been in prison , remember ? 
just like they figured there was no better person to catch one ... 
... here on earth to create havoc and terror . I am War , I am death . I am destruction . David Berkowitz , 1977 . 
for murder , though it have no tongue , will speak with most miraculous organ . 
Hamlet . what's David Berkowitz got to do with Sid 6.7 ? 
Lindenmeyer put increasingly complex combinations of criminal psychological profiles together to develop the ultimate villain . 
this is getting you pumped up , isn't it ? this is like the World Series to you . 
remember the bowling ball bag Sid carried with him in virtual reality ? 
what we need to do is stop playing with computers and go catch the son — of-a-bitch before he kills anybody else . 
give me your wrist . 
why didn't you tell me you had a daughter ? 
she's beautiful , you know ? 
want to tell me the real reason we stopped at your house ? 
you should practice lying more often . you're awful at it . where to ? 
what does that mean ? 
sounds to me like a well — educated way of saying you have no idea what to do next . 
I forgot what real coffee tastes like ... 
don't worry about it , all right ? 
relax . I know what you meant . 
don't get out of the car . 
what the hell's going on ? ! 
enjoying yourself ? 
this isn't a game , Parker ! 
what's the problem ? 
whatever he was doing here was only the start . 
it's not just Sid 6.7's performances that are increasing . stars need bigger and bigger audiences . whatever Sid is going to do next , it's going to involve media . 
real effective security ... 
which way ? 
Parker - — stop ! stop ! don't make me shoot you — — 
Grimes is back ! he's back ! he's come back ! ! ! 
we know you didn't kill those guards . 
how did you find out about the toxin ? 
you're not capable of it . 
I told you before , Grimes liked to be obvious . 
if we find Sid , Lindenmeyer won't be far behind . 
that , or living through him ... 
I'm not sure ... on the bridge ... the guy at the payphone ... 
can I ask you something ? 
you've already fulfilled the terms of your pardon . you stopped Sid 6.7 and you've got his module . you're free to go — — right now . why are you going to do this ? 
that's why I'm asking . 
you okay ? 
more or less . 
my guess is dead . 
how's your pulse ? 
then shoot him already . 
what do we do now ? 
don't be angry with me , Daryl . 
should I have ? 
true genius is rarely rewarded within its lifetime . 
it was me , what ? 
I couldn't just let them make you bring down my degree of difficulty . I'm a triple-twisting , double back flip off the high platform , not a swan dive . 
which God would that be , the one who created me , or the one who created you ? in your world , the Lord giveth , and the Lord taketh away . but in my world , the one who gave me life doesn't have the balls to stop a couple of bureaucratic assholes from taking it away . 
you catching my drift ? 
Sid — — NO ! ! ! 
I am beautiful , aren't I ? 
help me get out of here . 
you made me a composite of 183 of the most vicious people who ever lived . what do you think I'm doing ? 
I told you this would work .. By setting back the clocks , he has absolutely no idea he's in virtual reality . he still thinks he's in the real world . 
how should I know ? 
I wonder how that ... 
he's developing a Hemisphere imbalance . 
if I don't adjust the level of neural information each side of his brain is receiving , he won't be able to walk when I take him out of VR . 
hey ! ! ! 
I haven't been working on anything . 
get that fucking thing away from me ! 
watching your VR people Auto reset gave me the idea . 
coordinated by polymer neural net . 
it's better than real . it's synthetic flesh . synthetic blood . synthetic organs ... It's a physiological machine . 
as far as the public is concerned , it is . the reason you got fired , and I got my second demo into production , is I'm a lot smarter than you . I never give my best stuff away . 
amazing . I hate to say it , but it is . 
you need a maid . 
you embarrassed me in front of the highest — ranking law enforcement official in the country . do you have any idea how much money you just cost me ? 
I'm still making Adjustments ... 
I'M WHAT ? ! 
how does he know who I am ? 
what did Cox pull him out early for ? 
what the hell happened ? 
simulations are supposed to give participants practice in realistic , dangerous scenarios while protecting them from the risks they are exposed to in the real world . 
it makes me nervous just seeing him in a uniform . I will never forget the first time I saw the photos from the crime scene . 
I watched your simulation , Mr. Barnes . very impressive . you know , you're the only one to ever go up against Sid 6.7 who is still alive . 
not from in here . 
if Sid 6.7 hasn't killed you , we throw you back in here and you serve out the rest of your sentence . 
Barnes , where the hell have you been ? ! 
what did you find out ? 
it's already been called off . witnesses confirmed you weren't the shooter . did you find out where the bomb is ? 
enough to level an entire city block . 
demolition teams have searched everywhere in and around the hotel . I don't know where ... 
you know how much man power you're talking about ? 
this better not be a wild goose chase . 
Ms. Deane , you wanted to see me ? 
letting a lunatic like Parker Barnes loose in the free world is like lighting a fuse . at some point , he will go off -- you saw what happened in the simulator . the risk to the public is unacceptably dangerous . 
the man played judge , jury , and executioner with eight people's lives . he lost control and is capable of doing it again . 
... illegal search of Lindenmeyer' s duplex . eleven civilian vehicles damaged or destroyed . twenty — four citizen complaints . and the calls are just starting to come in ... I forgot what it's like to have you on the streets . 
none . he could be hiding , he could be helping Sid , or could be in little pieces on Santa Monica beach . any idea what Sid's going to do next ? 
I should have told him . 
I'm not sure . my guess is that's what Sid wants us to think . 
I think we both know who did . what's so urgent ? 
why didn't anybody tell me ? ! 
give me 30 seconds , then flip every switch you can reach . 
you all right ? 
you were supposed to act as if everything was real . 
before you , nobody else had gotten close enough to Sid 6.7 to take a shot at him . hell , nobody else had even been able to start tracking him before he got to them first . new scar — — you making it okay in there ? 
but with the six months off I get for being your guinea pig , I've only got to survive another 17 years , 5 months , and 23 days . 
you know those cheesy Christmas cards of your family under that tree in your back yard you keep sending me every year ? 
Parker Barnes , I'd like you to meet Crime Czar Elizabeth Deane . 
these were taken inside LETAC an hour ago . pretty pictures , aren't they ? 
Jesus Christ . can you kill it ? 
she's going to help you understand what makes Sid 6.7 tick . 
she wasn't part of the deal , Cox . 
officers in Toluca Lake just found an affluent couple ... completely gutted . so were the first two cops to arrive on scene . 
Sid 6.7 is now armed . 
don't worry , they have no idea where you are . 
she saved your life , Parker . she didn't have to , but she did . 
on my life , I promise you I will . 
my first two pairs of convicts suffered the same fate . 
you mean a nano — tech synthetic organism . 
recognize this ? how would you like your old job back ? 
this is the newest technology approved for general implementation . it's called a locater implant . every parolee gets one . we're going to know where you are every second for the rest of your life . 
yes or no , Mr. Barnes ? 
Madison lives two blocks from their present location . 
I wish we could hear them . 
he would slaughter eight people sitting in a room , but not two prison guards ? 
can you tell us what's on the disc ? 
it's not your fault . we appreciate you trying . 
you son-of — a — bitch , I'm going to kill you . 
I'm sorry , I thought you were somebody else . 
hello . 
good morning , Rita . how are we today ? 
how did you see me ? 
I'm going to the hen house . are you coming with me ? 
how do you feel ? 
that will soon pass . it's nothing . 
you fainted last night after supper . the master and I carried you here . 
she has the face of an angel . what a pity you can't see her . 
what about you , Manuel ? 
that's all right ; we all laugh here , but not at you ; I'll see to that . 
give the little girl to me . come here , sweetheart . are you ready ? 
don't talk like that ! 
would you mind telling me what I did wrong to you to deserve your insults ? 
mother ? 
I hardly know him . I saw him only once , some years ago . I can't even remember him . 
I don't want to leave the convent , Mother . 
he has paid for your studies and your maintenance , and he has just sent your dowry . does that mean so little to you , Viridiana ? 
good morning . you weren't expecting me , were you ? 
ever since yesterday , when we heard by chance about the tragedy , we have been very anxious for you . why didn't you write ? I would have come immediately . 
is there some grave impediment which prevents you from taking your vows ? there must be something . 
forgive me if I have offended you . 
have you repaired the windows of the dormitories ? 
what's going on , Moncho ? 
yes ! 
why are you crying ? 
don't invent stories ; go to bed . 
a black bull ! 
yes -- very , very big ! 
he came in through the cupboard . 
I'll box your ears if you don't show some respect for the dead ! you mustn't play under this tree . 
how do you do , Miss Viridiana ! 
why not ? 
where ? 
are you sure it isn't contagious ? 
they're varicose veins . it isn't leprosy . 
how are you today ? 
are your parents alive ? 
don't say that . 
you'll soon find out , you liar ! 
it's for people ! 
he's good at rabbiting and he knows it . when we're in the country , if he doesn't hunt he doesn't get fed . 
what's he called ? 
Miss Viridiana ... 
Jorge , Don Jaime's son , at your service . 
it's about time we spoke to each other , isn't it ? 
I don't know anything about these things , Jorge ... 
I know that you used to work with an architect . 
I don't understand how you can like being alone so much . 
what are you doing here ? get out . 
you won't get much done with those people . those times are over ! you ought to let me kick them out . 
I know perfectly well how little I can do . what I want to do is give passing Beggars a roof , some food , and a bit of human warmth . 
are they going to work here too ? 
don't forget the meeting with the lawyer . the car will pick you up tomorrow morning . 
yes . why ? 
and ... your friend ? 
is she coming back ? 
why ? 
why did he kill himself ? 
I don't know ; I can't remember . but I'm sure he loved you . 
you wouldn't be here otherwise . 
I don't know -- they've always been there . 
if you free me , you'll be a rich man ... 
I don't want you to untie me . kill him and then I'll give you the money . 
that will teach you not to bother me any more , you son of a bitch . 
what's the matter with you ? 
why the bad temper ? 
she's mad . 
so , Ramona ! 
if you wake first , wake me up . 
what I do every day , but I want to do it earlier . 
shouldn't I be ? you , on the other hand ... 
that your cousin is more to your taste . 
how in hell does it wind up ? 
don't be a fool ! why rush away from something which couldn't happen ? 
me ? 
it won't take but a minute . it's a votive offering for a lady who was cured just when she was dying of fever . our Lady of the helpless granted her a favor . 
thank you ; but it's missing something . 
my God , what have you done to him ! 
Ramona ! Ramona ! 
how much is that ? 
that's fifteen by seven ? 
have you thought of what you want planted yet ? 
it's for wheat . we've always grown maize in the strip above the vegetables . 
hold on , Ramon ! is there time to make another trip ? 
tonight , but I'll be back tomorrow afternoon . 
she won't even know . 
is it all right ? 
they told us you'd be back tomorrow ... 
leave me now . you can go to bed . 
why don't you ask her to stay on for a few days ? 
sit down , I'm going to need your help . 
I'd be really ungrateful , if I didn't like you , sir ; you took me and my little girl in when I didn't know where to turn . 
just say the word , sir , and I'll do anything . 
but sir , what can I say to her ? and why should she pay any attention to what a servant tells her ? 
speak to her again . explain everything to her seriously . 
but what can I say to her , sir ? 
you believe me , don't you ? 
don't lie . you don't believe me either . 
yes , Uncle . how are you ? 
excellent . what a charming , peaceful place , Uncle . 
how long are you staying ? 
was that difficult to get ? 
did you have so little interest in seeing me ? 
you have no feelings toward ... 
you've been neglecting the farm , Uncle . 
who is she ? 
come down . 
I know , Uncle , you've told me that already . 
I'm going to make you a nun's cake . it will make your mouth water . 
only because you want it . 
how did you know about that ? 
yes , it is . 
never . 
sometimes these things happen because of inexperience . sometimes it's because of ... 
his mother wanted to keep him . she came from a poor family . I was in love with your aunt . I would like to have acknowledged him but I was afraid of losing her . that's why I didn't say anything . 
thank you , Uncle . 
whatever you like . 
how strange you are ! when I asked you to do this favor for me you refused . you seemed almost offended . and now , here you are , making me so very happy all of a sudden . thank you , my child ! 
you must think I'm mad . 
if you only knew ... When I was young I was full of idealism . I wanted to do something on a big scale for others , something to show my great love for humanity . but as soon as I tried to do something about it , I became afraid that I would be laughed at and I felt like a fool ... and so I went back into my shell . 
Uncle , you mustn't think that I won't be sad to leave you . 
unfortunately ... 
yes , I don't want you ever to leave this house . 
leave us alone , Ramona . 
you're lying . 
think about it . don't hurry . think it over . 
let me pass ! 
I've listened to you long enough . let me out . 
you disgust me ... even if what you say is true . 
two . 
lots . it's got balconies and two big towers . 
when I wasn't so miserable I used to sell pigs . begging your pardon , I was more honest than my holy Mother . 
no , miss . smoking makes him spit and feel ill . 
they've got a real hen house here ! you can't hear yourself speak . 
what's that ? 
what about them ? 
which couch ? 
take me there . 
I'll come to you tonight . 
give them to Refugio . 
you'd like me to kill them ? 
stop this , stop this . 
where's the camera ? 
good times . 
she's dead . 
fucking desert . 
right . 
shut up Micheal . 
you see for me it's over . over baby . I'm gonna turn myself in . after the wedding of course . after the wedding . out of respect . 
I love it . I just love , love , love , love it . 
we're in no hurry . I think we'll take some time to enjoy each other , enjoy our freedom before we surrender ourselves to kids . 
we will . 
smart . smart . smart . think big picture , take your time . I wish I had . 
well , I just need your signature on these contracts and a deposit check so I can get the ball rolling . 
... embarrassing , shameful ... 
the stone age . 
a mutant species . 
we don't say " love , honor and obey " anymore . and we don't say " till death do us part . " today we say , " respect , honor and cherish , as long as you both do love . " how does that sound ? 
we don't think so . I mean , we just want the singing when I come out . 
what song ? 
oh I know that . how does it go ... 
Liz do you take Fisher to be your beloved husband , to respect , honor and cherish him till death do you part ? 
that ought to be about the end of that . 
no ... No . 
Boyd ... I don't know man ... It just seems to me that ever since you took Tony Robbins self-help thing ... you're all fucked-up in the head . 
the first day . 
I told her that I have no idea what Adam was talking about in that letter . 
I have no idea . 
I'm thinking about maybe making a move . 
Greenpeace . 
downstairs in the closet . 
my God ... 
did he try to kiss you ? 
you alright ? 
I guess . 
there . 
I think there's a lot of truth in that . I'm gonna pursue some options . I want to join that Big Brother thing . 
I think you'd make an excellent Big Brother . 
well that ought to be about the end of that . 
that's just insecurity . 
just insecurity . nut crunching gut splinters . 
it means she's insecure . 
Mike Brenn . yes . yes . 14.3 at 7.5 for 6 . at 29.83 at 9 . I'm amazed the windows don't blow out of their fucking sockets with all the repressed , ass-puckering rage in these soul-less lizards . 
same alarm clock every morning , same two pops on the same snooze button ... Micheal Brenn . yes ... Yes ... Hold your horses . okay . got it . 6.321 at 17.28 for 6.6 at 9.256 out at 3432.343 . same shower , towel , toothbrush , razor , hair gel . it's a fucking epidemic Fisher and you better start addressing it . you're getting married and I'm not going to candy-coat it . it just gets worse . it's an eighteen wheel cement mixer that will crush every bone in your body . 
you're not breathing right ? 
I don't care for him . 
I'll take a ride . 
I'm getting married ... 
dear God ... I don't know how to pray . 
where did you get that ? 
do you hear buzzing Fish ? 
yeah . I got some kind of buzzing . like a zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz thing just chipping away in the back of my skull . 
yeah , well , it's a nasty problem . 
Dad used to bring home these sparklers to me and Adam . out back we'd light' em up . the three of us . we'd hold' em up to the sky and watch the explosions of light . sparks . and dad would be all ... " Get ready " ... " watch for it " ... " here it comes , " here comes the " wahoo " . 
the sparkler would burn hot , then hotter , then even hotter ... and there would be one moment of pure burn when that little fucker would cook just perfect . perfect . it would only last a second , but that second was it . it was it . that's what dad had us looking for ... You get me ? 
that's my point ! you see Man ... burning at his absolute . to see all the forces just come together , just right , you know , just in perfect harmony . that's what I'm driving at . you get me ? 
I appreciate it . I do , but ... Maybe you ought to just ease up om yourself a bit . 
if I was to think ... If I were to think ... No I mean I have thinked it over ... I have . and without putting a lot of pressure on you I just ... Well I just ... 
I wanted to just take this final opportunity to visit with you . you know , just to be with you , father and son , before you run off and do your own husband , daddy thing . I'm just so Goddamn proud of you ... God knows I didn't always play it right with you ... 
you never walked away dad . you could have walked away . 
Harry chaplin . " cats in the cradle . " 
I love you dad . 
everything okay ? 
well , I'm in the middle of my Goddamn toast here . 
this is ridiculous . 
why can't we do it through the mail ? 
can't we do it on the phone ? 
why is this Kid staring at me ? 
did you send in all of the deposit checks ? 
what do you mean , you think so ? 
the wedding cake check ? 
photographer ? 
florist ? 
caterer ? 
hotel for my parents , the tent , the band , the Judge ... 
you forgot the tent ? 
why ? 
why did you forget the tent check ? 
you can't play around with these tent people . 
what else have you forgot ? 
I'm working my ass off here . I've taken care of absolutely everything Keith . 
don't you dare . 
don't you put this on me . don't do it , don't do it , don't do it , don't ... 
you know how important this is to my mother . you know that . 
I bet you didn't forget the bachelor party checks . 
I'm just saying I bet those checks all found the mailboxes . 
it amazes me how organized you and your little fun bunch can be when it comes time to mobilize to Vegas . 
well it's bad timing . 
right before the wedding ? 
I suppose Boyd is the creative force behind all this . 
he's a moron . 
why do you feel the need to explore this side of your personality ? 
I'm talking about the kind of people you hang out with ... about growing up , assuming responsibility of yourself . 
I just think that at some point you're going to have to re-evaluate some of your friendships ... 
Charles Moore for instants . 
it's not that I don't like him . but the wedding has really got me thinking and ... I just keep myself opening up . Crowning . and I want you keeping up with me here . 
I just don't see him in the big picture . 
he's weird . 
he's weird . 
why ? what's his problem ? 
he's weird . and I expect more from you . 
you're going to be hungover for three days . like those guys on " Oprah " that get drunk and have disgusting sex with prostitutes and then say their vows with the stench of cheap hotel whore sex all over them . 
it's vile ! 
I've seen it on television . 
I am not common Keith . I am not common . I am a creature like no other and I will not be commoned ! is that to much to ask ? is that to much to ask ! ? ! 
do you love me ? 
how much ? 
problems ? 
okay . 
I'm not . what's the problem ? 
what kind of seats can we have ? 
so what do we do ? 
go down where ? 
honey I don't have the time ... 
we're leaving in three hours . 
I'll call them from the road . 
more than I ever imagined being able to love anyone ever . 
we're leaving from Adam's . come send me off . 
will you please call the chair people ? 
do you love me ? 
just call and let me know that your okay . 
hello . 
hi . are you calling from jail ? 
well , the night is young . did you straighten out the chair situation ? 
well I do . 
what are you doing ? 
nesting ? 
I'm mad at you . 
hello . 
where are you ? 
how late ? 
okay . 
what ! 
I left a message . I think it's going to be okay . 
what's the word on the chairs ? 
" Darli ... ing you , ewe ewe ewe , send me , Darli ... ing you , ewe ewe ewe , mend me . 
after the wedding , which we're paying for ourselves , and this house ... 
well , can you come back inside ? 
now ? 
everything's OK . just some more preparations . 
cancel ? ! cancel ? ! are you out of your fucking mind ? ! 
no way . 
Lois is a mess and Micheal's really upset . everyone's upset . 
I know . 
I need you to pick up the cake tomorrow . 
yeah . you . 
that means we get five hundred thousand to help raise the kids . 
it's okay ... It's okay baby . cry for Mama . cry for Mama . 
Liz we've got to cancel , we have to put it off . 
do you love me ? 
do you love me ? 
oh God . we . Liz . we . we . killed a woman . we ... 
oh Liz . we . God . we , in Vegas . Micheal crushed her skull . she was dead . there was nothing else to do . it was an accident . 
the prostitute . 
no Micheal did . it was an accident . 
Micheal , by accident . 
it's too late . 
she's in the desert . she's out in the desert . 
she's not alone ... She's ... Boyd ... Oh God ... He's gone nuts ... He killed Lois and Micheal ... it's all ... 
but ... 
but ... 
he kept saying he was protected . 
like if something happened to him , he could still get us . 
the only proof is those bodies . 
move the bodies . 
I ... Liz ... all I ever wanted , was for you to be happy . I just wanted to give you the wedding , the life you always dreamed of ... ... I just love you so much ... So much ... 
if you don't tie up all the loose ends it'll never be over . 
you put him down or don't bother coming back . 
do you love me ? do YOU LOVE ME ? ! 
all right then . it's refreshing to see two young people not afraid of real commitment . will you have friends or family saying words - singing or anything ? 
may we have the rings please ? 
these rings represent the commitment Fisher and Liz make to each other on the day . Fisher do you take Liz to be your beloved wife , to respect , honor and cherish till death do you part ? 
the hell I did ! 
the hell I did ! 
Nope . 
you hate women . 
true . 
you have a King fantasy . 
and what happens when you can't ? 
if I'm the king of Israel , I say to myself , King , I say to myself , King ... Take a good look around . what do I see ? 
then what do they have ? 
I say to myself , look at the map . look what's all around you . people who wish bad bad things for you and your people . for thousands of years the Jews are fighting everybody . it used to be they'd throw rocks , then the iron revolution and they would attack with spears . then the gunpowder revolution . now they're shooting fire power back and forth , all day bullets flying , babies getting shot . 
the Israelis can protect themselves . they got the Mossad thing happening . Mossad's for real , man . they scalp babies . 
what ? what's your point ? 
what ? 
the Mexicans would love it . they're dying for a little order down there . they need direction . 
a little gut check time fellas . a time for some serious self-exploration . how do I function ? for real ? no more bullshit . can I keep my cool when they bounce my bananas ? when they won't play my fucking song ? etc , etc . do you get me ? do you get me ? 
oh that's just nothing . that's just a missing persons thing , that's all . 
this is going to stop right now . right now ! 
the need to know is clear . what did Adam tell Lois ? that's the name of the game . what did Adam tell Lois ? what does Lois know ? 
you want some breakfast meat . Micheal . is that what you want ? 
easy Micheal . 
we're goosed . 
we're goosed ! Goosed by God ! 
stop it ! 
stop . 
how about my Fatburger ? 
you said that Boyd . 
Tony ? this is Keith Fisher . you're doing my wedding and I'm calling about the chair situation . yeah , I'll hold . 
prison Communication Systems . an acquaintance friend of mine is professionally involved with a communications outfit in Denver that I just happen to know for a fact is about to be rewarded a very large , exclusive contract to rewire every state prison in Colorado . yes sir . 
that would translate to government guaranteed contract in excess of 35 million dollars . 
oh , Jesus ... call the police . 
she's dead . call somebody ! 
call 911 . 
fuck ! fuck you fucking guys ! 
oh God . this is insane . 
all right people . new plan . not even a new plan so much as a modification of the old plan . 
that is a load of shit . personal power has nothing to do with any of this . Tony Robbins has helped me to unlock energy and see my options more clearly , yes , but to give him credit for this , for all of this ... Well that's just more than the man deserves . 
what kind of words ? 
no , this is the perfect time . this is real time . Adam . your brother and I , as well as several others present , have always suspected that you ... ... are a fully repressed , living in major denial , locked down , fly-boy butt-fucker . 
Fisher had a less than normal relationship with that donkey . 
the problem was our quarterback had trouble remembering his right from left ... 
OK . definitely not cool ! definitely inappropriate behavior here . 
negative . this is not what we have worked out in terms of presented behavior . 
easy Boyd . 
he's cracked up . 
Boyd ... What have we done ? 
what is the question you asked me ? 
yes , you did . now that is the question ! that is exactly the question we should be asking ourselves . you tell me Fisher . what have we done ? 
say it again . 
what you just said . say it again . 
what's your point ? 
regarding what ? 
Jesus Boyd you're going to O.D. him . 
after you drop the kids off , take Micheal home . put a few drinks in him so he'll sleep . 
just do it . 
what does that mean ? 
I don't know ... 
okay . here's the deal and it's a good one . Lois is cool . it's a pacified situation . 
yeah . 
hear what ? 
now ? 
isn't it a little late ? 
this is a situation that defies judgement . we have acted and showed courage that is not of a kind known by most . 
my what ? 
you care to add a little specification to that slanderous accusation ? 
okay fine . 
whatever you say Kojak . 
blood money . insurance dollars that you have thus fucking far decided not to tell me about at all . in no way have you mentioned that money . and I find that to be very very offensive . 
and if you think you can fuck me , don't . cause I'm fucking insulated Fisher . protected . backed up on floppy . do you get me ? I want my fucking money ! 
I'm a lifesaver . a lighthouse . up all night in the rain , in stormy gale force wind , tornado and fucking earthquakes . I stay lit for you . I stay lit . I don't go dark . I never go dark ! 
no I don't . 
your investment ideas never work out . 
I don't think so Boyd . 
but not tonight . 
Keith Richards , Dean Martin ... 
he's right . 
I got her arm . 
the past is the past . today is the beginning of the rest of our lives . 
what's goosed ? 
he just had two . 
he's too drunk . 
what is it ? 
what ? 
she's not here . 
who ? 
Yup . 
that's right . 
she's in the bathroom ... she's still working . 
that's right . 
is everything okay ? 
she's in there ! 
don't sweet lip me . 
you're a liar . I want to know what happened in Vegas . 
Micheal ? do you have something to tell me ? 
he's upset about Adam . we're all upset . 
my god . 
yes money . Adam had a five hundred dollar term Life Insurance Policy . 
actually , no . Adam was switching to a Whole Life Policy , but re-scheduled his medical exam ... and failed to make his last payment ... so his term Life lapsed . so it's value is Null and void . now he did have a pension account , worth another 150 thousand . 
and a house . valued at 350 thousand . 
so . when is the wedding . 
we'll be ready Adam . 
that's one idea . 
real times . 
no . no . no . it's what my father said to me . he said it and he meant it ... He said to me ... He said , Adam , he said ... He told me and I heard him ... he said ... Hell he said so many Goddamn things I can't remember everything he said for Christsake . 
are you solid with that ? 
the bucks gonna stop right here . if my son doesn't know the six New England states , if he has trouble with geography , I won't stick it in his face . I'll help the little guy . I'll put him in the car and take him out there . I'll take him to Maine for a big Lobster dinner , go skiing in Vermont , hot dogs at Yankee Stadium ... I won't stare him down . 
I won't do it . 
I tell mine that they're little men . I tell them they're strong . they make me feel joy . I let' em know . so they really know that I need them just as much . you know . just as much man . and you know , you're their godfather ... 
if anything ever happens to me ... 
either side you idiot . I'm calling 911 . 
no way . 
I want you to hear me out . 
you and I have done nothing . you especially . we are innocent . 
Jesus Adam , can we not get into this now please ? 
I got you . 
don't snap at them ! 
what ? 
later . 
where's the candy ? 
what do you mean ? it's it's a Goddamn mini-mart ? ! 
don't even start . 
one idea that if you had fucking listened to , you would each be worth approximately 15 million dollars . 
more . 
she's got no fucking pulse . 
wait ! 
what are you doing ? 
I'm calling the ambulance . 
calling the ambulance . 
we have to call the ambulance . 
stop it ! listen to me . let's just take a second here and take hold of the situation , OK ? let's just review our options here . 
call the police . okay , that's one option . 
stop it ! 
just stop . 
I'm calling the police . 
bury her out in the desert . 
you don't just casually walk out of a Vegas Casino with a dead woman . 
have you completely lost your mind ? so you get her out of here . so you get her out into the desert somehow , without anybody seeing , so what , you don't think at some point somebody might notice that she's gone ? 
her blood is all over the bathroom . I'd say that's a bit of a DNA problem . 
her fucking head was caved in . 
wrap her up in blankets . bring the car around to the back of the hotel , throw her off the balcony , put her in the car ... Done . 
we check out the area and wait for a time when it's clear . 
someone goes to WalMart , gets some buckets , brushes , mops , spic and span , the works . 
sun rises at 5 : 52 . 
wait . wait a minute . 
we can't do this . 
how do you figure ? 
so that's what we're doing . 
she's Asian . they don't have Jews in Asia . 
well what the fuck are we supposed to do ? 
we have to get going . 
now I am the last to say that we have done here is a good thing . it's not . it's not a good thing . but it was , given the circumstances , the smart play . we did what had to be done . and ... well ... I'm proud of us . I'm proud of each and every one of us . we performed . under the most complex and nerve shattering of situations , we stood fast and we delivered . I feel proud . 
Boyd you idiot , the shit's coming down ! 
you got us into this mess . 
would you , shush ? ! these phones aren't secure ! 
watch the tone fella . 
what is your problem ? 
what ? 
who ? what are you talking about ? 
you got some mighty fucking fine bad timing Adam . we got a rehearsal situation here . 
I didn't do anything ! I'll turn your pathetic ass in ! 
I won't calm down . I can't do this . we can't do this . it won't work . it will not work . 
I'm talking about DNA samples , fiber optics , search parties , they got infrared scanners , FBI scientists . they figure this shit out . they always figure it out . 
all right . let's all go back in . Adam ? you're cool right ? 
we're leaving from my house in three hours . if you want to come , get your numbers in order by then . 
no first of all . I'm not in a game mood . 
because my opinion threatens yours , it's poorly developed ? 
you're an asshole Adam . 
oh , and why am I an asshole ? 
name one . 
tonight we return once again to the cave . tonight we let the monsters out . we fill ourselves with the spirits of Genghis Khan , Joe Namath , JFK , Paton , Lombardi , Hemingway ... 
I was just playing ... we were playing just playing around . 
we were playing ... she slipped ... she hit her head . 
the floor was wet . she slipped ! 
I don't know why the floor was wet ! 
why ? 
this is pathetic . 
what did you say ? 
don't point at me . 
I have plenty of friends . 
the hell I don't . 
about anybody but yourself . you never have . 
if you ever touch my minivan again , I'll make you sorry . real sorry . 
you got a retarded kid and a fat pig wife . 
don't you threaten me you little rat fuck . 
go home ! 
how ya doing ? 
what's that ? 
I said how's it going ? 
well that's what I said . 
she's fucking hot ! 
Jesus . 
they'll get us on accesory to murder . 
I'm not going to ruin my life over a dead whore . 
can't do what ? 
but you said grey , sir . 
she'll be out in a moment . 
yes ! that's it ! 
oh , yes ! it may need some slight alterations , but it is madam's size . all right , dear . we'll have it for you to try in a moment . 
well ... 
well , if it's absolutely necessary ... 
yes ... the Beautiful Carlotta ... the Sad Carlotta ... 
it was hers . it was built for her . many years ago . 
she died . 
by her own hand . there are many such stories . 
OW ! ! 
it's this darned corset . it binds . he retrieves the stick . 
well , you know those police department doctors : no sense of style . ah , tomorrow ! 
more than you think . 
please ! and what happens after tomorrow ? 
what are you going to do ? now that you've quit the police force ? 
no , it's your life . but you were the bright young lawyer who decided he was going to be chief of police some day . 
why ? 
it wasn't your fault . 
Johnny , the doctors explained -- 
well , you've got it . and there's no losing it . and there's no one to blame . so why quit ? 
it's where you belong . 
nothing for a while . you forget , I'm a man of independent means . or fairly independent . 
to forget ? don't be so motherly , Midge . I'm not going to crack up . 
it's a brassiere . you know about those things . you're a big boy , now . 
it's brand new . revolutionary uplift . no shoulder straps , no back straps , but does everything a brassiere should do . it works on the principle of the cantilever bridge . 
an aircraft engineer down the peninsula designed it . he worked it out in his spare time . 
how's your love life , Midge ? 
well ? 
aren't you ever going to get married ? 
yeah , I'm a brute . we were engaged once though , weren't we ? 
ah , sweet college days . but you're the one who blew it . I'm still available . available Ferguson . say , Midge , do you remember a guy at college named Gavin Elster ? 
I got a call from him today . funny . he dropped out of sight during the war , and I'd heard he'd gone East . I guess he's back . it's a Mission number . 
could be . 
well , I'm on the bum ; I'll buy him a couple of drinks and tell him my troubles . but not tonight . if you won't drink with me , I'll drink alone , tonight . 
Midge , what did you mean , there's no losing it ? 
my ... the acrophobia . 
I think I can lick it . 
that ! ? ! 
now . I look up , I look down . I look up , I look down . nothing to it . 
step number two . 
easy , now . 
Johnny ! 
now , that's the kind of greeting a girl likes . none of this " hello you look wonderful " stuff . just a good straight " who do you know " -- 
not that kind of history . the small stuff ! about people you never heard of ! 
yeah . 
who ? 
who shot who in the Embarcadero in August , 1879 . 
do you know him well ? 
now then , Johnny-O ; pay me . 
for bringing you here . come on , tell ! 
you'll tell , or you'll be back in that corset ! come on ! 
here you are . 
I've told you enough . 
out . I've got things to do . 
and the idea is that the Beautiful Mad Carlotta has come back from the dead , to take possession of Elster's wife ? ah , Johnny ! come on ! 
Carlotta ? 
Midge ! 
I did . since when do you go about slipping notes under men's doors ? 
just wander . 
around . 
Mm . better . 
yeah . 
what was this desperate urge to see me ? 
well , I detected an undercurrent . 
fair enough . what'll we talk about at dinner ? 
what I've been doing ? 
naturally . 
oh , I'm having a wonderful time ! I've gone back to my first love ... painting . 
well , it's a living . but I'm excited about this . 
is there something I can do for you ? 
oh , yes ! 
please answer my question . 
what is her name ? 
Carlotta Valdes ? 
how long has she had the room ? 
does she sleep here ? ever ? 
when she comes down , don't say that I've been here . 
I saw her come in five minutes. ago . 
and there ! there you see ? her key is on the rack ! 
her car is gone . 
why am I here ? what happened ? 
you don't remember . 
do you remember where you were ? 
where were you ? 
... Old Port Point ! out at the Presidio ! of course I remember ! I often go there ! 
because I love it so . it's beautiful there . especially at sunset . ah ... thank you for the fire . 
when ? 
oh ... wandering about . 
please drink your coffee . 
I'm sorry . I didn't mean to be rude . 
wandering about . 
the Palace of the Legion of honor . the Art Gallery . 
lucky for me you were wandering about . thank you again . I've been terrible bother to you . 
when you ... There were pins in my hair ... 
you shouldn't have brought me here , you know . 
you could have looked in my car . oh , but you didn't know my car , did you ? 
my name is John Ferguson . 
John . old friends . acquaintances call me Scottie . 
no , I wouldn't like that . and after what happened today I should think you could call me Scottie . or even John . 
wander about . 
one shouldn't live alone . 
will you tell me something ? has this ever happened to you before ? 
... falling ... into San Francisco Bay ? 
oh ! yes . hello . 
I ... suddenly felt such a fool . 
oh , yes . fine . no after effects . but as I remember now , that water was cold , wasn't it ? what a terrible thing to do ... and you were so kind ... It's a formal thank-you letter . and a great big apology . 
oh , yes ! the whole thing must have been so embarrassing for you ! 
-- talking to you ... 
would you like some coffee ? 
I couldn't mail it ; I didn't know your address . but I had a landmark . I remembered Coit Tower and it led me straight to you . 
I hope we will , too . 
meet again , sometime . 
I don't know . 
no . 
no , I Just thought I'd wander . 
oh , yes , I forgot : it's your occupation , isn't it ? 
wander separately ? ah , but only one is a Wanderer . two , together , are always going somewhere . 
do you know where you're going ? 
how can you be sure ? 
how old ? 
what are you thinking ? 
their true name is Sequoia Sempervirens : always green , ever- living . 
why ? 
do you hear anything ? 
and no birds sing . 
no . 
where are you now ? 
where ? 
have you been here before ? 
long ago ... 
no ! ... No ! 
no , don't ask me ! 
I didn't jump , I fell ! you told me I fell ! 
what was it inside that told you to jump ? 
what ? ! 
take me away from here ? 
but the small scenes , the fragments in the mirror : you remember them . 
what do you remember ? 
no ... it's in shadow . 
a grave ... 
I don't know . an open grave . I stand by the gravestone looking down into it . and it's my grave . 
I know . 
no . it's new and clean , and waiting . 
this part is dream , I think . there is a tower and a bell and ... a garden below ... but it seems to be in Spain ... a village in Spain . and then it clicks off , and is gone . 
no . 
but I'm the woman in the mirror ! 
if I could find the key ... find the beginning put it together ... 
I'm here , I've got you ... 
don't leave me ... stay with me ... 
I should have phoned ... but I wanted to see you ... be with you ... 
no , don't go away ! 
where's your husband ? 
it was a dream , you're awake , you're all right , now . can you tell me ? 
yes -- 
tell me . 
go on . 
-- and an old wooden hotel of the old California days , and a saloon ... dark ... low-ceilinged ... with hanging oil lamps . 
no , never ! 
go on with your dream . what was it that frightened you ? 
here with you . 
yes . 
my love ... because I love you . 
no ... we're together ... 
there are things I have to tell you , about how we met , and why we are together . but they can wait . the only important thing now is that I love you and I'm going to keep you safe . 
why ? 
where ? 
Madeleine -- 
it's not fair , it's too late . it wasn't supposed to happen this way , it shouldn't have happened ... ! 
let me go ! let me go ! ! 
yes . 
I won't lose you . 
why ? 
could I ask you a couple of questions ? 
is this some kind of Gallup Poll , or something ? 
do you live here in the hotel ? 
0h , I thought so ! a pick-up ! well , you've got a nerve , following me right into the hotel and up to my room ! you beat it ! go on ! beat it ! 
listen , I'm going to yell in a minute ! 
just let me talk to you . 
you . 
I've heard that one before , too . I remind you of someone you used to be madly in love with , but she ditched you for another guy , and you've been carrying the torch ever since , and then you saw me and something clicked . huh ! 
well , it's not going to work . so you'd better go . 
I warn you , I can yell awfully loud . 
your name . and -- 
who you are -- 
-- and how you happen to be living here . 
but you haven't lived here long . 
no , a year ago ! where did you live a year ago ! ! ? 
but before ! where did you live before ! ? ! 
listen , what is this ? what do you want ? 
will you have dinner with me ? 
well , I feel I owe you something for all this ... 
then will you for me ? 
just dinner . 
because I'd like to have dinner with you . 
I'll get my car and be back in half an hour . 
an hour ? 
thank you again . good-night . 
tomorrow night ? well -- 
tomorrow m -- but I have to go to work . I've got a job . 
and what will I live on ? my oil wells in Texas ? 
no , Judy , you don't understand . 
no . 
I just want to see you as much as I can ! 
yes . 
no . 
no , Judy , I'm not going to move ! please ! stay in the chair ! 
I like that one . 
okay . now we're going to buy you some clothes . 
there's Ransohoff's . nothing but the best . come on . 
but I like that one , Scottie . 
Scottie , what are you doing ? 
but I loved the second one she wore . and this one -- -- is beautiful . 
you want me to dress like her ? 
ah , no ! ! ! I don't want to be dressed like someone dead ! 
Judy , it can't make much difference to you . I just want to see how you'd look and I know it won't be the same , but -- 
I don't like it ! 
I wish you'd leave me alone . I want to go away . 
no , you wouldn't let me . and I don't want to go ... 
I know . because I remind you of her . the one that's dead . and not even that , very much . 
the color of your hair ... 
Judy , please it can't matter to you ... 
yes . 
well ? 
where shall we go for dinner ? 
Ernie's ? 
Mmmm . 
oh , no . you'll muss me . 
no , Ernie's is fine . 
I've got it . he bends down and bites the back of her neck . 
Scottie ! 
can't you see ? 
I feel like driving . are you terrible hungry ? 
where are you going ? 
Scottie , why are we here ? 
but why ? why here ? 
I need you . 
I can't do it alone . I need you , to be Madeleine for a while . then , when it's done , we'll both be free . 
... We stood there and I kissed her for the last time . and she said , " If lose me , you'll know that I loved you -- 
and I couldn't follow her . God knows I tried . one doesn't often get a second chance . I want to stop being haunted . you're my second chances , Judy . 
you look like Madeleine , now . go up the stairs . 
we're going up the tower , Madeleine . 
we're going up the tower . 
I'm going to . it's my second chance . 
but you knew , that day , that I wouldn't be able to follow you didn't you . who was at the top when you got there ? Elster ? with his wife ? 
and she was the one who died . not you . the real wife . you were the copy , you were the counterfeit . was she dead or alive when you got there ? 
took no chances , did he ? and when you got there , he pushed her off the tower , was that it ? but you were the one who screamed . why did you scream ? 
yes ! 
your accident ... 
I don't know ... Switzerland ? 
I made it . 
oh , Judy ! ! when he had all her money , and the freedom and the power ... he ditched you ? what a shame ! but he knew he was safe . you couldn't talk . didn't he give you anything ? 
and the necklace . Carlotta's necklace . that was your mistake , Judy . one shouldn't keep souvenirs of a killing . you shouldn't have been that sentimental . 
I loved you , Madeleine . 
love me ... keep me safe ... 
hello . 
no , she's all right . she's still here . but I'll get her home soon . 
did she hurt herself ? 
how'd you get into the shipbuilding business , Gavin ? 
interesting business . 
you don't have to do it for a living . 
how long have you been back ? 
and you like it . 
like all this . 
shouldn't you be sitting down ? 
I was sorry to read about that thing in the papers . and you've quit the force . a permanent physical disability ? 
would you like a drink now ? 
not what you think . we're very happily married . 
I'm afraid some harm may come to her . 
no . 
I'd say you'd better take her to the nearest psychiatrist , psychologist , neurologist , psychoanalyst , or plain family doctor . and have him check you both . 
I didn't mean to be that rough . 
no . 
how often does this happen ? 
where'd she go ? 
well ? 
have you talked to the doctors at all ? 
I can get you a firm of private eyes to follow her for you . they're dependable , good boys -- 
it's not my line . 
how can I see her , to know her ? 
Ernie's . 
you've done well , Scottie . you're good at your job . 
yes . 
I didn't know where she was going to lead you . 
Carlotta Valdes was what : your wife's grandmother ? 
well , that explains it . anyone could develop an obsession for the past , with a background like that . 
knows nothing of a grave out at Mission Dolores , or an old house an Eddy Street , or a portrait at the Palace of the Legion of Honor ? 
and when she goes to those places ... 
how do you know all these things she doesn't know ? 
why did she never tell her daughter ? 
he had no right to say that . it was my responsibility . you didn't know her . I shouldn't have got you involved . 
doctor , how long is it going to take you to pull him out of this ? 
he won't talk . 
I can give you one thing : he was in love with her . 
Franky can't make it . he had an appointment he forgot , he's going to see you later . I'm Mickey Morrissey , we're supposed to get to know each other . 
Stearns , Harrington , you know who that is ? 
a huge law firm . okay ? they put him in the firm , he's married , everything's superb . Franky , he's starting to talk like he comes from Dorsetshire , some fuckin' place ,' You must drop by with Pat and me ...' Okay ... ? 
... and he's making a billion dollars every minute working for Stearns , Harrington , and he bought a dog , and everything is rosy . then Mr. Stearns , he tried to fix a case . 
huh . 
me , too . 
Dr. Towler ... 
you have a record of what happened in the operating room ... 
... there are notations every thirty seconds ... 
... of the procedures ... 
we , we were rather busy ... 
as I've said we had some more ... 
we had rather more important things on our mind than taking notes . we were trying to restore her ... 
... we were trying to restore her heartbeat . 
we'd gone to' Code Blue ,' we were administering electro ... 
brain damage could have been ... it didn't necessarily take nine minutes , it could have been caused in two ... 
yes . 
because she was anemic . it's right there on her chart . her brain was getting less oxygen anyway ... 
I want to buy you a drink . 
well , well , well . huh ? 
it's a long road that has no turning . 
hi . 
you live in the neighborhood ? 
how old is he ? 
thank you . 
who told you that ? 
Mrs. Simmonds . 
I used to be a nurse . 
Kathy Price ... 
you were the Admitting Nurse at St. Catherine Laboure Hospital on May twelfth , nineteen seventy-six , the night Deborah Ann Kaye was admitted ... 
yes . 
Kathy Costello . that's my maiden name . 
yes . 
one hour . 
and did you write the numeral' one' down on the record , standing for one hour ? 
a single hour . 
I spoke to her , and everything is all right . 
she told me . 
I just saw her . 
what ? 
I'm ... Mrs. Doneghy ? I'm Frank Galvin ... why didn't you go in ? 
it's not a good case . it's a very good case . a healthy young woman goes into the hospital to deliver her third child , she's given the wrong anaesthetic ... 
... I'm sure you do ... 
... I know . I went ... 
yes . yes , I have . 
... fifty thousand dollars ? 
... I understand ... 
... I understand ... 
he saw her at the Northern Care ... 
we just can't do it anymore . this is our chance to get away . 
what does it mean ? I ... I mean we , you have other tactics ... 
are we going to win ? we have , you know , other tactics , though ... 
hi , Mickey ... 
uh ... 
... now who is that ... ? 
Sally Doneghy , now who is that ? 
... hey , I don't need your charity ... 
I have to talk to you . 
come on . let's get a drink . 
are you out of your mind ... ? 
you need my help ... ? you need a goddamn keeper ... are you telling me that you turned down two-hundred- ten grand ? huh ... ? are you nuts ? eh ? are you nuts . what are you going to do , bring her back to life ? 
to do what ... ? to do what , for chrissake ... ? to help her to do what ? she's dead ... 
that's the point , you stupid fuck . let them buy it . we let them buy the case . that's what I took it for . you let this drop -- we'll go up to New Hampshire , kill some fuckin' deer ... 
what ? 
I know what I said but not now . you won it . Franky . you won it . when they give you the money , that means that you won . we don't want to go to court -- is this getting to you ... ? you know who the attorney is for the Archdiocese , Eddie Concannon . 
... he's a good man ... ? he's the Prince of fuckin' Darkness ... he'll have people in there testifying that the broad is well -- they saw her Tuesday on a surfboard at Hyannis ... don't fuck with this case . 
Frank , but not now . Frank . you're trying to wipe out some old business . but not now . I understand . but you go call' em back . you call the Bishop back . 
we've got her sister . Testifies she had a meal one hour before she was admitted to the hospital . this is the point . 
Admittance form is wrong . 
I've got my Dr. Gruber , says her heart condition means they gave her the wrong anaesthetic anyway , plus she came in complaining of stomach pains ... 
they had an obstetrical nurse in there . we got a deposition from the obstetrical nurse ? 
right . 
right . 
you got a good memory , Franky . 
Jimmy ? Bushmills . lookit , do me a favor . I'll buy you a drink tomorrow . 
been a long time , huh ... ? 
Mary Rooney . she won't talk to me . I tried her at the hospital . I'm going to try her back at home . read this . 
so what ... ? the best is yet to come . check the TV Guide . they got our Dr. Towler on a panel on GBH on Friday :' the Healing Hand . the Experts Speak .' 
what I'm saying , they're getting some help . 
John : gimme a cuesta-ray . 
today is Tuesday . what ? 
give' em a box of Macanudos . 
what happened , Joey ... ? 
yeah ? how's our new witness ? 
she's workin' the late shift at the Hospital . she's at home now , I'm going over there to talk to ... 
how are you holding up ? 
and all we've got is a witch doctor ! 
okay . what do you do when you don't have a witness ? 
that's right . 
are you with me ... are you awake ... ? 
Rooney's protecting someone . who is she protecting ? 
she's protecting the Doctors she'd be up there on the stand ... 
... one of the other nurses ? 
all right . who wasn't in the O.R. ? 
uh ... the admitting nurse ... 
she didn't do anything . she took the patient's history and signed the charts .' K.C.'' Kathy Costello ...' 
we don't have anything from the Nurse Association ? 
... yeah ... good ... 
... four years ago ... 
what the hell are you doing here ? 
what are you doing in New York ... ? 
I talked to Johnnie White at the Bar Association . the broad used to work for one of Concannon's partners in New York awhile ago . she wanted to move to Boston . how badly did she hurt us , Joe ? 
we got a mistrial , you know . Joe -- did you hear what I said ... ? 
Dr. Gruber . 
I had an appointment at his office , I think I must have got it wrong . we had a meeting ... 
Dr. Halpern's taking all his ... 
d'you find an apartment ? 
I changed my life today . what did you do ? 
why ? 
what Hotel are you staying at ? 
I'm a lawyer . 
really . how wonderful for you . 
oh , actually it was . then why'd you call it off ? 
a brick house says you divorced him . I'll put you on your honor . bet you a hundred dollars against you join me for dinner . and I'll take your word for it . now you tell me the truth . because you cannot lie to me . what's your name ? 
my name's Frank . and furthermore , you came back to see me tonight . 
the weak , the weak have got to have somebody to fight for them . isn't that the truth ? you want another drink ? 
Jimmy ! that's why the court exists . the court doesn't exist to give them justice , eh ? but to give them a chance at justice . 
they might . yes . that's the point ... is that they might ... you see , the jury wants to believe . they're all cynics , sure , because they want to believe . I have to go in there tomorrow to find twelve people to hear this case . I'm going to see a hundred people and pick twelve . and every one of them it's written on their face ,' This is a sham . there is no justice ...' but in their heart they're saying ,' Maybe ... maybe ...' 
maybe I can do something right . 
would you like me to leave ... ? is this a bad time -- ? 
is this a bad time . 
what happened ... ? 
... and is that serious ? 
no , no , I'm just ... 
I've got to work . 
you're going to stay here ... ? 
do you think it's my fault ? 
that's not the question . it's over . do you think that it's my fault ? if I'd ... if I'd ... I never should have taken it . there was no way that I was going to win . 
that's what I am . 
yes . 
I ... do you want me to leave ? 
I ... 
who told you that ? 
and what makes you so tough ? 
is there going to be a later ... ? 
if I don't' grow up ...' 
you , you don't under ... 
it's over ! 
what is that to you ... ? 
Joe ... Joe ... 
no ... no ... 
no . 
thank you . 
Continental Casualty ... 
business hours are over , Sir . this is the switch ... 
I'm sorry , Sir , we're not allowed ... 
I can't guarantee that ... 
Mr. Galvin's ... 
hello , I'm calling from ... 
I'm calling from Professional Nurse Quarterly ... 
this is Mr. Wallace in subscriptions ? 
this is Miss Costello ... ? 
Kathy Price . 
my subscription lapsed three years ago ... 
missus ... 
we get it at work . we get the magazine at work . 
Yessir . I'm sorry . 
now , have you boys tried to resolve your little difficulty because that certainly would save the Commonwealth a lot of time and bother . 
I'm sure it is , Frank : and let me tell you something . if we find it so complex , how in the hell you think you're going to make a jury understand it ? see my point ? let's talk a minute . Frank : what will you and your client take right now this very minute to walk out of here and let this damn thing drop ? 
that's it ... ? come on , guys ... life is too short ... You tell me if you're playing' chicken ,' or you mean it . Frank : I don't think I'm talking out of school , but I just heard someone offer you two hundred grand ... and that's a lot of money ... and if I may say , you haven't got the best of records . 
I wasn't disbarred , they dropped the pro ... 
what is it ? 
that's perfectly all right . 
I had a witness disappear on me . 
I could subpoena him if I had a week . 
is the Plaintiff ready ? 
sustained . yes . the witness will confine his testimony to review of the hospital records . 
yes , Mr. Galvin ? 
I'm an attorney on trial before the bar . representing my client . my client , do you understand ? you open your mouth and you're losing my case for me . 
no , no , you listen to me . all I wanted in this case is an even shake . you rushed me into court in five days ... my star witness disappears , I can't get a continuance , and I don't give a damn . I'm going up there and I'm going to try it . let the Jury decide . they told me Sweeney he's a hard-ass , he's a defendant's judge . I don't care . I said , the hell with it . the hell with it . I'll take my chances he'll be fair . 
and don't give me this shit ,' I was a lawyer , too .'' cause I know who you were . you couldn't hack it as a lawyer . you were Bag Man for the Boys and you still are . I know who you are . 
damn right I'm done . I'm going to ask for a mistrial and I'm going to request that you disqualify yourself from sitting on this case . I'm going to take a transcript to the State and ask that they impeach your ass . 
nothing further , your Honor ... 
I object , your Honor ... 
exception ! 
I'm Joe Galvin , I'm representing Deborah Ann Kaye , case against St. Catherine Laboure . 
I'll just take a minute . Deborah Ann Kaye . you know what I'm talking about . the case is going to trial . our chief witness is a Dr. David Gruber , you know who he is ? 
he's the Assistant Chief of Anesthesiology , Massachusetts Commonwealth . he says your doctors , Towler and Marx , put my girl in the hospital for life . and we can prove that . what we don't know is why . what went on in there ? in the O.R. That's what we'd like to know . something went wrong . and you know what it was . they gave her the wrong anesthetic . what happened ? the phone rang ... someone got distracted ... what ? 
I want someone who was in the O.R. We're going to win the case , there's no question of that . it's just a matter of how big ... 
you know what happened . 
and ask me what ? 
I didn't do it , Mister . 
who says that I'm protecting anyone ? 
I don't owe them a goddamn thing . 
you know , you're pushy , fella ... 
well , maybe you better do that , then . you know you guys are all the same . you don't care who gets hurt . you're a bunch of whores . you'd do anything for a dollar . you got no loyalty ... no nothing ... you're a bunch of whores . 
yes ? Galvin , right ? 
... Deborah Ann Kaye ... 
they called , they're going to settle , what I want to do is build up as much ... 
the Archdiocese called , they want to settle ... her estate ... 
yes . 
yes . 
uh ... in the , well , in the interests of her family ... you , Dr. Gruber , you know , you can never tell what a jury is going to do . St. Catherine's a very well thought of institution . her doctors ... 
) I'm sorry ... ? 
do you know who her doctors were ? 
the most respected ... 
the hospital is owned by the Archdioceses of ... 
well , well , when can we meet again . I'd like to get a deposition .. 
we have to ... we ... we have to keep you under wraps . please don't , don't discuss ... 
... that's perfectly all right . 
Dr. Towler ; page 406 ,' Contraindications to general anaesthetic . ideally a patient should refrain from taking nourishment up to nine hours prior to induction of general anaesthetic .' does that sound familiar ? 
&apos; practice and Methodology in Anaesthesia .' General textbook on the subject . is that correct ? 
and you wrote that ... 
... Page 414 ,' If a patient has taken nourishment within one hour prior to inducement , general anaesthetic should be avoided at all costs because of the grave risk the patient will aspirate food particles into his mask .' is that what happened to Deborah Ann Kaye ? she aspirated into her mask ? 
if she had eaten , say one hour prior to admission , the inducement of a general anaesthetic ... the type you gave her ... would have been negligent ... ? 
Dr. Thompson ... ? 
I have some errands to run , and then I thought we'd spend the evening ... 
I'm going to take you to the home to see the girl ... 
yes . yes . I think so . I hope you'll be comfortable . I'm putting you up at my ... 
... apartment . no , no . please . you don't know who we're dealing with , I , please believe me , they ... 
these people play very rough . they don't want to lose this case . there's a lot of pressure they can bring to bear , I ... 
cardiac arrest . during delivery her heart stopped . when the heart stops the brain's deprived of oxygen . you get brain damage . that is why she's in the state she's in today . 
I didn't do too well for you . 
I'm afraid that's not true . will you want me to stay on till Monday ? 
you know ... sometimes people can surprise you . sometimes they have a great capacity to hear the truth . 
you sure you don't want me to stay on . 
are you saying that a failure to restore the heartbeat within nine minutes in itself constitutes bad medical practice ? 
then you're saying there's no negligence , based on my question ? 
the Doctors were not negligent . 
they gave her the wrong anesthetic . 
her sister said she ate one hour prior to admittance ... she ... 
... she went in complaining of stomach cramps . good doctor would have doubted the information on the chart . 
what qualifies you as an expert in anesthetics ? 
Easthampton Hospital for Women . excuse me , what is that , a joke ? let me tell you something , Doctor , those men at Catherine Laboure . men who are known not only in this city , but the world , were trying to save a woman's life . they were there , and here you are , four years later , read some hospital report , and say ... 
she getting good care over there ? 
then what good would it do to ruin the reputation of two men , to help a girl whose life's not going to be changed in the least ? you know what CODE BLUE means ? 
please sit down . I told your wife . I'm sorry that we have to meet out here . I've got a case coming in two days in the Superior Court and my office is a mess of papers . 
... the Archdiocese called up , they said who was our attorney ,' cause the case is coming to trial ... 
... we told them we didn't want it to come out this way . 
what is this going to cost ? 
you said you're gonna call me up . you didn't call me up . who do you think you are ? who do you think you are ... ? 
I'm going to have you disbarred . I'm going to have your ticket . you know what you did ? do you know what you did ? 
you ruined my life , Mister ... Me and my wife ... and I am going to ruin yours ... You don't have to go out there to see that girl . we been going four years . four years ... my wife's been crying herself to sleep what they , what , what they did to her sister . 
what you thought ! ? what you thought ... I'm a workingman , I'm trying to get my wife out of town , we hired you , we're paying you , I got to find out from the other side they offered two hundred ... 
you guys , you guys , you're all the same . the Doctors at the hospital , you ... it's' What I'm going to do for you' ; but you screw up it's' We did the best that we could . I'm dreadfully sorry ...' And people like me live with your mistakes the rest of our lives . 
you are aware of the penalties for perjury ... ? 
I wouldn't do it . 
no . 
yes . 
yes . 
yes . 
I . . .. 
I ... yes . 
I ... 
they lied . 
I do . yes . 
that's not my handwriting . 
yes , I , yes , I signed it , yes . but I , I didn't write that figure . 
... what in the world would induce you to make a photocopy of some obscure record and hold it fouryears ? this is a ... why ? why would you do that ? 
and why , please tell us , would you think that ? 
your Honor , Bishop Brophy and the Archdiocese have offered plaintiff two hundred and ten thousand dollars . 
Mr. Concannon ... ? 
objection ! this is ri ... expect us to accept a photocopy , we have the original right ... 
no further questions . 
thank you , your Honor . we object to the copy of the admissions form as incompetemt and essentially hearsay evidence and cite McGee versus State of Indiana , U.S. 131 point 2 and 216 through 25 of the Uniform Code :' the admission of a duplicate document in preference to an existing original must presuppose the possibility of alteration and so must be disallowed .' and , your Honor , having given the Plaintiff the leeway we would like your ruling on this issue now : we object to the admission of the Xerox form . 
the document is disallowed , the jury will be advised not to consider the testimony of Kathy Costello regarding the Xerox form . it's unsubstantiated and we can't accept a copy in preference to the original ... 
I'm going to uphold that . 
that is correct . I was engaged to render an opinion . 
just as you are , Sir ... 
no , I am not . it's quite common in New York State ... 
no . 
no . 
I'm just an M.D. 
I know of him . 
through , through his book . 
meth ... Methodology and Technique ... 
&apos; Methodology and Techniques of Anesthesiology .' yes . 
I am seventy-four years old . 
I'm on the staff of ... 
sir . yes . when a thing is wrong ... as in this case , I am available . I am seventy-four years old , I am not board-certified . I have been practicing medicine for forty-six years and I know when an injustice has been done . 
I did . 
Ed Concannon . 
objection , we've ... 
we've touched on this , his own witness has said ... 
objection ! 
no , actually , she was referred to me . she was Dr. Hagman's patient ... 
whatever the' truth' is , let's hear that . you were her doctor . 
say it . 
you were the anesthesiologist at her delivery May twelfth , nineteen seventy ... 
answer affirmatively . simply . keep those answers to three words . you weren't' part of a group ,' you were her anesthesiologist . isn't that right ? 
you were there to help Dr. Marx deliver her baby . were you not ? 
anything special about the case ? 
thank you . when Debby ... 
we went to Code Blue ... 
it's a common medical expression , it's a crash program to restore the heartbeat . Dr. Marx cut an Airway in her trachea , to get her oxygen , her and the baby ... Ms.Nevins ... 
well , many reasons , actually ... 
she'd aspirated vomitus into her mask ... 
that's right . 
well , we ... 
yes . 
... We did everything we could ... 
yes ! 
my God , we tried to save her ... You can't know ... You can't know ... 
what are you doing here ? 
... yes . get her on the phone ... 
Gruber ... 
... he wants to testify ... ? 
you know what that would mean ? to get somebody from a Boston hospital to say he'll testify ? 
this is going to drive the ante up . 
that's the call that I'm waiting for . 
they want to settle . it means a lot of money . 
it's a generous offer , Mr. Galvin ... ... nothing can make the woman well ... but we try to compensate ... to make a gesture ... 
we thought it was just . 
yes . 
that was our insurance company's recommendation . 
nothing that we can do can make that woman well . 
what is the truth ? 
he was accused of jury tampering . 
four cases in three years ... 
... tell me about this case . 
no -- we don't want this case in court . 
I want to settle this thing and be done with it . I don't want the Archdiocese exposed . 
so what I want to do is stop it here . I'm going to make him an offer . I want to do it myself . I want it to come from me . 
if we were to go to trial , would we win the case ? 
I know that answer . if we went to trial would we win ? 
why did he go to see Mary Rooney ? 
what did he find ? 
how good's your intelligence ? 
and so what is the rest of his case aside from Dr. Thompson ? 
Mr. Abraham ... 
Abrams . yes . how are you today ? 
good . you ever been inside a hospital ? 
my client offers his full cooperation in these proceedings . in exchange , his testimony is to be sealed and all matters incriminating to himself are to be rendered inadmissible . 
no provisions , nothing . my clients testimony for his immunity . 
counselor , I will prosecute your client . 
I' 11 take my chances then . I' 11 feel safer without a job if a man like Mr. Kint is behind bars . 
you're joking . 
counselor , you're insulting me . 
verbal , you know we're trying to help you . 
verbal , I know you know something . I know you're not telling us everything . 
I know you liked Keaton I know you think he was a good man . 
he was a corrupt cop , verbal . 
Keaton was a piece of shit . 
according to your statement you are a short-con operator . run of the mill seams . everything you do , you learned from somebody else . 
oh , I know . sweet deal you have . total immunity . 
you know a dealer named Ruby Deemer , verbal ? 
you know Ruby is in Attica ? 
there's nothing in there about Ruby . 
the first thing I learned on the job , know what it was ? how to spot a murderer . let's say you arrest three guys for the same killing . put them all in jail overnight . the next morning , whoever is sleeping is your man . if you're guilty , you know you're caught , you get some rest - let your guard down , you follow ? 
I' 11 get right to the point . I'm smarter than you . I' 11 find out what I want to know and I' 11 get it from you whether you like it or not . 
heartwarming . really , I feel weepy . 
oh come on , verbal . who do you think you're talking to ? you really expect me to believe he retired ? for a woman ? bullshit . he was using her . 
sure . and I'm supposed to believe that hitting the Taxi Service wasn't his idea 
come on . Keaton was a cop for four years . who else would know the Taxi Service 
let me tell you something . I know Dean Keaton . I've been investigating him for three years . the guy I know is a cold- + blooded bastard . L.A.P.D. indicted him on three counts of murder before he was kicked off the force , so don't sell me the hooker with the heart of gold . + 
I don't know about that . 
he wasn't behind anything . it was the lawyer . 
you think I don't know you held out on the D.A. ? what did you leave out of that testimony ? I can be on the phone to Ruby Deemer in ten minutes . 
not FROM ME , YOU PIECE OF SHIT . there IS NO IMMUNITY FROM ME . you atone with me or the world you live in becomes the hell you fear in the back of your tiny mind . every criminal I have put in prison , 
is he the one that killed Keaton ? 
so this lawyer ... 
came from Redfoot . 
do you believe in him , verbal ? 
I came clean . I told it like it happened on the boat . so what if I left out how I got there ? it's got so many holes in it , the D.A. would've told me to blow amnesty out my ass . so you got what you wanted out of me . big fucking deal . 
you tell me , Agent Kujan . if I told you the Loch Ness Monster hired me to hit the harbor , what would you say ? 
I've got immunity now . what can you possibly offer me ? 
where's your head , Agent Kujan ? where do you think the pressure's coming from ? Keyser Soze - or whatever you want to call him - knows where I am right now . he's got the front burner under' your ass to let me go so he can scoop me up ten minutes later . Immunity was just to deal with you assholes . I got a whole new problem when I post bail . 
that was how I ended up in a barber shop quartet in Skokie , Illinois . 
oh , but it's not . if I hadn't been nailed in Illinois for running a three card Monte in between sets , I never would have took off for New York . I never would have met Keaton , see . that barber shop quartet was the reason for everything . 
the quartet is part of the bit about Kobayashi . the quartet was in my file , along with every other thing I had done since high school , see ? aliases , middle- men . they knew me better than I did . they knew all of us . 
give a guy a break , huh ? 
then what ? 
I wanted to . I thought we could make it . 
a man in a suit with a slim build . tall . 
don't shine me , verbal . no more stalling . you know what I'm getting at . 
I don't know what you're talking about . 
I don't understand what you're saying . I saw Keaton get shot , I swear to you . 
I WAS AFRAID , OKAY ? somehow , I was sure it was Keyser Soze at that point . I couldn't bring myself to raise my gun to him . 
he was a stool pigeon for the Justice Department . he swore out a statement to Federal Marshals that he had seen and could positively identify one Keyser Soze and had intimate knowledge of his business , including , but not exclusive to , drug trafficking and murder . 
his own people were selling him to a gang of Hungarians . most likely the same Hungarians that sate all but wiped out back in Turkey . the money wasn't there for dope . the Hungarians were going to buy the one guy that could finger Soze for them . 
but Keaton had . Edie Finneran was his extradition advisor . she knew who he was and what he knew . 
there were no drugs on that boat . it was a hit . a suicide mission to whack out the one man that could finger Keyser Soze so sate had a few thieves put to it . men he knew he could march into certain death . 
he wanted me to live . 
Edie . 
because he was my friend . 
no ... 
no , NO , NO , NO , NO . 
Edie ... 
this is all bullshit . 
I knew him . he would never - 
if he's dead , verbal - if what you say is true , then it won't matter . it was his idea to hit the Taxi Service in New York , wasn't it ? tell me the truth . 
I didn't know . I saw him die . I believe he's dead . Christ 
you know what it's like , Agent Kujan , to know you'll never be good ? not good like you . you got good all fucked around . I mean a stand up guy . I grew up knowing I was never going to be good at anything' cause I was a cripple . shit , I wasn't 
you think he's .. ? 
you posted twenty minutes ago . Captain Leo wants you out of here a.s.a.p. , unless you turn state's . 
where are you going to go , verbal ? you gonna run ? turn states evidence . you might never see trial . if somebody wants to get you , you know They'll get you out there . 
even if I was to let you talk to him , he won't talk to you . he's paranoid about being recorded and he knows the interrogation rooms are wired 
no , no , no , no , no . 
and I am sure you have a host of wild + theories to answer these questions . 
that's crazy , Dave and it doesn't matter . he has total immunity and his story checks out . he doesn't know what you want to know . 
his name was Arturo Marquez . a petty smuggler out of Argentina . he was arrested in New York last year for trafficking . he escaped to California and got picked up in Long Beach . they were setting up his extradition when he escaped again . get this - Edie Finneran was called in to advise the proceedings . 
what do you mean I can't see him ? 
did they charge him with anything ? 
two hours , tops . 
he won't go into the interrogation room . 
where ? 
no matter . he'll have to know how close we came . 
I' 11 find him . 
a rumor is not a rumor that doesn't die . 
nothing . something I - forget it . 
take your time . enjoy L.A. 
I hear you did time with old spook . yeah , he was a good egg . I used to run a lot of dope for him . fuckin' shame he got shivved . 
better you hear it from me now than somebody else later . 
get a grip . I didn't know . 
the job got thrown to me by this lawyer . 
some Limey . he's a middle-man for somebody . he doesn't say and I don't ask . 
he wants to meet you . he called last night and asked me to set it up . what do I tell him' 
my employer requires your services . one job . one day's work . very dangerous . I don't expect all of you to live , but those who do will have ninety-one million dollars to divide any way they see fit . 
my employer wishes to remain anonymous . 
I work for Keyser sate . 
Mr. Soze made a few calls , yes . you were not to be released until I came to see you . it seems Mr. Keaton's attorney , Ms. Finneran , was a bit too effective in expediting his release . holding the rest of you became a moot point . 
the answer is no . 
listen to me , cocksucker . there is no Keyser sate . if you say his name again , I' 11 kill you right here . 
ahh , Mr. Hockney . do join us . 
Mr. so- My employer has made up his mind . he does not change it . 
I am sorry , Mr. McManus. f implore you to believe me , Mr. Keaton . Mr. Soze is very real and very + determined . 
what did you say ? 
no matter . kill away , Mr. McManus . 
am I ? 92 92 INT . hallway - fiftieth floor 
I'd have to say my spine was broken , Keyser . 
let's say for example - 
with what ? 
county . I was in for fraud . 
what the hell do you want ? 
I did you a favor by standing up for you last night , but don't think we're friends . I'm sorry , but I have other things - 
get out . 
don't hurt me . 
they - That's bullshit . they don't operate anymore . 
what fence ? who ? 
never heard of him . 
what's with you ? what do you care whether I come or not ? 
you watch your mouth . 
I was out of line . 
I' 11 be alright . 
forget it . I' 11 probably shit blood tonight . 
McManus wants to go in shooting . I said no way . 
they're pretty pissed off . they'll do anything . now I got a way to do it without killing anyone : but like I said , they won't let me in without you . 
maybe more . 
not if we do it my way . 
don't do this . send her a card - something . 
what is it Keaton ? 
what is this ? 
What-are they speaking ? 
Keaton , I can't just - 
what if I 
I know you . you don't think I know you're on the take . this whole fucking precinct is dirty . you don't have a fucking leg to stand on . 
me too . 
you heard right . 
he's alright . 
Keaton , we gotta go . they're gonna find him . 
it's a logistical nightmare . close quarters , no advance layout , ten men , maybe twenty . 
you're fuckin' A right , no P.C. Well screw P.C. No right . no goddamn right . you do some time , they never let you go . treat me like a criminal , I'll end up a criminal . 
I'm sure you can understand my hesitation . 
don'T MOVE , YOU fuckers . 
everybody I ever worked with , did time with . 
it's bullshit . this guy could be L.A.P.D. I think it's a setup . 
I'd say you've gotten on his main and central nerve , McManus . 
forget him . it's not important . I was trying to make a point . 
how many times have you been in a line- up ? it's always you and four dummies . the P.D. pays homeless guys ten bucks a head half the time . no way they'd line five felons in the same row . no way . and what the hell is a voice line-.up ? a public defender could get you off of that . 
it was the Feds . a truck load of guns gets snagged , Customs comes down on N.Y.P.D. for some answers - they come up with us . they're grabbing at straws . it's politics - nothing you can do . 
fuck you . I' 11 never shit right again . so who did it ? own up . 
this is not right . 
come on . the guy is a pipe dream . this Kobayashi is using him for window dressing . 
I know who he is . 
so what is it you do , Mr. Kint ? 
now remember , this is another kind of business . they don't earn your respect . you owe it to them . don't stare them down but don't look away either . confidence . they are fools not to trust you . that's the attitude . 
... and the desk Sergeant is actually trying to tell me he can't release you ? can you believe that ? you weren't even charged . new York police - Jesus . I want to take pictures of your face to bring to the D.A. first thing in the morning . 
I' 11 have this thing in front of a grand jury by Monday . 
they want more time to think about investing . 
they just said they wanted time . 
give me some credit . I got you this far , let's go to the grand jury . this is never going to stop if we - 
don't give up on me now , Dean . 
I love you . 
come home , Dean . 
that's enough , Edie . 
Edie , please . 
not dope . something else . some what ? .. He doesn't knob what they were buying . but not dope ... people . 
&amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; No , no , no . I need a guarantee from the ridiculous man . I am going to be killed . I have seen the Devil and looked him in the eye . &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; 
&amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; Keyser Soze . Keyser sate . I've seen his face . I see it when I close my eyes . &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; 
&amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; It was smaller than that . sharper . &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; 
&amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; It is longer than that . and not so dark . &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; 
&amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; Don't be stupid . &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; 
Jack . what are you doing here ? 
yeah . 
there was ninety-one million - 
what was the money for ? 
I don't get it . 
who ? 
a boy came across a body on the beach this morning . thrown clear when the boat burned . shot once in the head . two guys from the F.B.I. just identified him . + 
Keyser Soze 
what was you shootin' at us for , anyhow ? 
well , this here's Ned Logan ... Ned , this here's the Schofield Kid , nephew of Pete Sothow an' ... 
I was only checkin' it for you . thought maybe somethin' was bent . 
well , you was shootin' every which way an' ...

depends what he told you . about Bill , you mean ? 
he's gonna die , ain't he ? 
well , suppose he does ? 
that ain't what I mean . 
I can't spot' em myself but you could . that red-haired one , you could spot a half-mile off , I bet . 
I'll ride up close an' shoot' em ! 
I told you I'm a damn killer . I done it before . I'm more killer than him . 
what is it , son ? 
I guess you lost some hogs to the fever .

naw , son , I didn't kill nobody .

we done stuff before for money , Ned .

how long you gonna be , Bill ? 
Yup . you still got the Spencer rifle ? 
he musta been movin' right along . 
got used to my bed . ain't gonna feel to home out here . 
it ain't nothin' , don't fret it . she don't like it much , you goin' off with me . 
she gave me the evil eye . 
I ain't blamin' her , Ned , I ain't holdin' it against her . she knew me back then ... an' she seen what a no good sonofabitch I was ... an' she won't allow how I've changed . she just don't know how I ain't like that no more . 
I ain't the same , Ned . Claudia , she ... straightened me up , got me clear of the whiskey an' all . us goin' to do this killin' ... that don't mean I'm back to like I was . I just need the money ... for a new start ... for them youngsters . remember that drover , the one I shot in the mouth so's the teeth come out the back of his head ? I dream about him now an' again . I didn't have no reason to shoot him ... not one I could remember when I sobered up . 
nobody liked me ... none of the boys . they was scared of me ... figured I might shoot' em out of pure meanness . 
eagle ... he hated my guts . Bonaparte didn't like me none . 
Quincy , he was always watchin' me . scared . 
hell , no . I'm just a fella now . ain't no different from anyone else no more .

I never c-c-carry arms . I'm ... a writer . 
B-b-books . you ... you killed five men ... singlehanded . 
Wh-wh-who did you kill first ? 
Wh-wh-when confronted by superior numbers , the experienced gunfighter will fire on the best shots first . 
I was lucky in the order . I always been lucky killin' folks . 
William Munny , yeah . 
you shot Charlie Pepper , didn't you ? and you're the one killed William Harbey an' robbed the train over ... 
you're Pete Sothow's nephew , huh ? hell , I thought maybe you was someone come to kill me ... ... for somethin' I done in the old days .

maybe I ain't . 
he said that , huh ? 
Schofield ? you from Schofield ? 
oh .

what for ? 
Jesus ! 
I ain't like that no more , Kid . whiskey done it as much as anythin' I guess . I ain't touched a drop in ten years . my wife , she cured me of it ... cured me of drink an' wickedness . 
she's passed on , Kid . 
been gone near three years now . 
don't tell nobody about the reward an' all . don't need no other gunmen tryin' to collect . 
well , we was . like you said , I changed my mind an' ... 
well , now Kid , there's two of these cowboys , ain't that so ? better there's three of us ... maybe them cowboys got friends . maybe ... 
three ways , I figured . 
you're goin' back with him ?

is it him ? 
did ... you ... get ... him ? 
cover me , Kid , while I mount . 
yeah , I guess so . 
say , Bill ... 
that was ... the first one . 
first one I ever killed . 
how I said I shot five men ... it wasn't true . that Mexican ... the one that come at me with a knife ... I busted his leg with a shovel ... I didn't shoot him or nothin' . 
H-hell yeah . I killed the hell out of him ... three shots ... he was takin' a sh-sh-shit an' ... an' ... 
oh Ch-ch-christ ... it don't ... it don't seem ... real ... How he's ... DEAD ... how he ain't gonna breathe no more ... n-n-never . or the other one neither ... On account of ... of just ... pullin' a trigger . 
well , I gu-guess they had it ... comin' . 
I trust you , Bill . 
wha ... what f-for ? 
you ... gonna take ... the money ? 
you could have it . all of it . 
this here money , take my share an' Ned's an' leave it with my youngsters . tell' em half goes to Sally Two trees if I ain't back in a week . the rest is yours ... you could buy them spectacles . 
you're gonna kill him , ain't you ? 
I was watchin' you ... seein' if you was followed . 
yeah , he went South ahead of us . I guess we'll catch him before ... 
no he ain't . he went South yesterday . 
little Bill . the ... the Bar T boys caught him and Little Bill ... 
N-no . he ... he beat him up . he was making him ... answer questions ... and beating him up ... and then ... Ned just died . little Bill didn't mean to kill him ... he said he was sorry an' all ... but he said it was a good example anyhow . 
they got ... a sign on him says he was a killer . 
in front of Greely's . it says , " This here is what happens to ... " 
the questions Little Bill asked him ... what sort of questions was they ? 
what'd Ned say ? 
then ... what ? 
an' Little Bill killed Ned for what I done ? 
he said how you was really Three fingered Jack out of Missouri ... an' Bill said " Same Three fingered Jack that dynamited the Rock Island and Pacific in' 69 killin' women and children an' all ? " an' Ned says you done a lot worse than that , said you was more cold blooded than William Bonney or Clay Alisson or the James Brothers an' how if he hurt Ned again you was gonna come an' kill him like you killed a U.S. Marshall in' 73 . 
N-no , sir ? 
you work for the railroads too , Mister Beauchamp ? 
it's only a b-b-b-book ... 
the ... Duck of Death . 
that is you there , ain't it , Bob ? the Duck of Death ? 
uh ... It's ... uh ... generally considered desirable in the publishing business to ... ah ... take certain license in depicting the cover scene ... for ... ah ... purposes involving the ... ah , market place . 
uh ... I can assure you , Mister Daggett ... the events described within are based ... on the accounts of eye witnesses and ... 
duck , I says . " you have insulted the honor of this beautiful woman , Corcoran , " said the duck . " you must apologize . " but Two Gun Corcoran would have none of it and , cursing , he reached for his pistols and would have killed them but The Duck was faster and hot lead blazed from his smoking sixguns . " 
well , Mister Beauchamp , I was at the Blue bottle saloon in Wichita the night English Bob killed Corky Corcoran ... an' I didn't see you there ... nor no woman , nor no twogun shooters nor nothin' like that . 
first off ... Corky didn't carry two pistols , though he should of . 
and ? 
you ... you mean ... English Bob killed him while ... ? 
but if the other fellow is quicker and fires first ... 
but ... if he doesn't miss ? 
them's the keys . all you gotta do is shoot me an' you an' English Bob can ride out free as birds . 
R-r-r-really ? you r-r-really w- wwant ... ? 
" well , Jim , " I says , " it makes me sick to see a man struttin' around and packin' two pistols an' a Henry rifle and cryin' like a baby . " 
uh ... Sheriff ... Uh ... 
maybe you should ... hang the carpenter . 
uh , no . no , I ain't drunk . 
well ... uh ... I ... I ain't got no , uh , firearms . 
I ... dunno . I mean , I guess not . no , they ain't carryin' no guns . 
like I said , I ... 
uh , William ... uh ... Hendershot . 
I ... I guess I might ... but like I said , I ain't armed . 
uh ... yeah . yeah . 
he should have armed himself if he was gonna decorate his saloon with the body of my friend . 
I have done that ... killed women and children ... I have killed most everything that walks or crawls an' now I have come to kill you , Little Bill , for what you done to Ned . now step aside. boys . 
" deserve " don't mean shit , Little Bill . 
shut up , Alice . little Bill , a whippin' ain't gonna settle this . 
this here's a lawful contract ... betwixt me an' Delilah Fitzgerald , the cut-whore . now I brung her clear from Boston , paid her expenses an' all , an' I got a contract which represents an investment of capital . 
damaged property . like if I was to hamstring one of their cow ponies . 
she could maybe clean up around the place or somethin' , but nobody's gonna pay good money for a cut-up whore . 
hit your finger , huh ? 
heard you done the roof yourself . 
what's all that wood ? 
yeah ? 
shit , skinny , we got railroad Barons an' cattle Barons , but you' re gonna be the first of the billiard Barons . 
an' all them cowboys been riding that beef down to Kansas an' Cheyenne ? 
all week ? 
word must have got all the way to Texas by now . 
they really got all that money , them whores ? 
that much , huh ? 
I could run off them whores . 
we got one of them fuckers , Sheriff , out by cow Creek , we ... 
hell , yeah . a bunch of us Bar T boys went out lookin' on account of them killin' one of our own . we come across this fucker on a roan goin' South an' ... 
no ... but I guess he will soon enough . had a Spencer rifle on him an' he was ... 
uh ... a little , maybe . 
Hullo , Bob . boys , this here is English Bob . 
been a long time , Bob . you run out of Chinamen ? 
well , I was always tasting the soup two hours after I et it . 
I heard that one myself , Bob . hell , I even thought I was dead til I found out it was just I was in Nebraska . who's your friend ? 
books . he's my biographer . 
not really ... Maybe a couple of Peacemakers ... I imagine you could overlook those , eh , Bill ? if you didn't see them ... or hear them ? 
Charley , see what kind of " books " Mister Beauchamp is packing ... but watch you don't get wet . 
you leave me at the mercy of my enemies . 
I thought ... you was an angel . 
you don't look nothin' like me , mister . 
they went out scouting when they saw your fever broke . 
on the Bar T ... looking for ... them . 
three days . are you hungry ? 
I thought I was gone . see them birds ? most times I wouldn't even notice them birds much . but I'm noticin'' em real good' cause I thought I was dead . 
are you really going to kill them ? 
them other two , they been takin' advances on the payment . 
free ones ? 
you want ... a free one . 
I didn't mean ... with me . Alice and Silky , they'll give you one ... if you want . 
you're a beautiful woman an' ... if I was to want a free one , I guess I'd want you more than them others . it ain't ... See ... I can't have no free one on account of my wife ... 
yeah . see ? 
she back in Kansas ? 
... wouldn't let you settle it , huh ? 
he tell you where them others is ? 
didn't give us nothin' but his own name ... Ned Roundtree . 
where's Little Bill for Christ sake ? 
he's coming ain't he ? 
what'd he say ? 
asked what they looked like , that's all . Christ , maybe he's tough but he sure ain't no carpenter . 
we never seen him up against any ... like these ones ... killers . 
I wouldn't point no pistol at nobody , sir . 
now this Strawberry Alice person , tell me again . 
billiards , eh ? even though I don't really wish to play ? 
ah , I see . 
what did you think , they come clear up from Kansas to fuck us ? 
what wife ? he don't have no wife . 
where'd you get the money , huh ? 
you told them cowboys you had it . 
what you gonna do when somebody comes to collect ? fuck' EM ? fuck' EM A thousand TIMES ? the kind of people who'll come after that thousand , they won't tolerate if you don't have it . they won't just cut your face up a little . stupid cunts ! 
she's gonna live . she didn't steal nothin' , She didn't touch his poke . 
a whippin' ? that's all they get ? after what they done ? 
I fined' em instead . 
ain't you seen enough blood for one night ? hell , Alice , they ain't loafers nor tramps nor bad men . they're hard workin' boys that was foolish . why if they was given over to wickedness in a regular way ... 
if they was just here for the fuckin' , how come they lit out the back window ? 
you just kicked the shit out of a innocent man , you big asshole . 
no more sitting in this room . I've let it go on long enough . 
... I got a present for you . 
well , go get it then . 
we're going to prevent any substantial atrophy of your good leg with this . it works the quadriceps . 
twelve years . 
now you're going to have to tell me more . 
how so ? 
any way , fate stepped in and took football out of the equation . 
is this a religious thing ? 
for a second there I thought you were a fanatic . 
how are you feeling ? 
you are in the emergency room of the University of Pennsylvania Hospital . you were in a serious accident . how's your vision ? 
where were you sitting on the train ? 
yes . where are the rest of the passengers ? 
no . 
it's my field . I represent athletes . I'm an agent . 
is that right ? 
you represent someone in Philadelphia ? 
not really .

Jeremy , why don't you go sleep with your mom ? 
I think it's be better if I was alone . 
he going pro in the draft . they say he can run the fifty-- 
I'm going to go in . 
why'd you do that ? 
Jeremy . I'm going in . I have to do some things . 
I'm going to work out . 
you think you could beat up Mike Tyson ? I mean before he started wiggin out and eating people's ears ? 
no . 
you put too much . that's two hundred and fifty pounds . 
I mean if you knew Karate ? 
how much did you take off ?

what do you do if something happens ? 
how many did you put on that time ?

I'm not scared .

you won'T GET HURT ... 
that was me they were talking about . I almost died . that was me . 
I'll just shoot him once . 
don't be scared . 
Dunne , it's Jenkins , we got a guy at gate 17C with a bogus ticket . says he knows you . he won't tell me his name . 
he's got the most beautiful eyes ... The hell kind of question is that ? he's a guy . 
yeah ? 
when ? 
I am . I'm helping him with the sale . 
he's spoken of you . he says you're becoming friends . 
he's doing well today . 
he's kind of a miracle . 
you've never been sick ? 
how certain are you that you haven't been sick in your life ? 
seventy-five percent ? that's not nearly good enough for me . I'm extremely skeptical . 
what's he talking about ? 
I assumed because of the train . 
you forgot the " Now I'm going to tell you what the hell is going on " step . see usually that comes before the , " It's over " Step . and it always , always comes before the " You can go " Step . what is over ? 
this city has had its share of disasters . well publicized ones . it was around the time of that plane crash , when it first entered my head . and there it stayed , as I waited and watched the news over the years ... And then one day I see a news report on a train accident and its sole survivor who was miraculously unharmed . and just like that , an idea blossoms into the flower of possible reality . 
at the church ... You were following me weren't you ? 
what's this about ? this is obviously some scam . is this where you tell me one of those pictures is like an investment ? 
it's for last week's game . 
what do you want ? 
we're not proceeding anywhere together . 
why is it , do you think , that of all the professions in the world ... you chose protection ? 
just give me a minute . 
I got you a seat in the seven hundred level . it's nose-bleed territory , but at least you won't get spit on . 
probably the army jacket . those guys carry hunting knives and stuff for show . 
I thought he was carrying something . 
I got this picture of a silver handled gun tucked in his pants . like on t.v. 
like what ? 
yes . 
I don't know what you're asking ? 
listen . I got to be on the sidelines during the game ... You can get to your seat by taking the stairwell at-- 
okay , I don't want to play this game anymore . 
the guy might not have been carrying anything . 
I have to go now . 
quick . 
I must have felt some lump in his back when I bumped him . most guns have a black or silver handle . I had a fifty-fifty shot at the color . 
stop messing with my life Elijah . my son almost shot me last night . he wanted to prove you were right . 
you have a problem , Elijah . my wife is right . somewhere along the line one of your bones broke and your mind just broke with it . 
I'm still going to New York . just not this second . 
is Jeremy okay ? 
I don't know . it's been a while . 
okay . 
not a specific day . what's this about ? 
... I can't remember . 
is that what you wanted to ask me ? 
is there anything else you wanted to ask me while I'm up ? ... When was the last time you wore pink ? when was the last time you drank soup standing up ? final call for strange questions at two in the morning . 
when was the last time I wore pink ? 
oh shit ... 
I've come to a decision . 
Megan ? 
yeah ? Megan where are you calling from ? 
... When you work with clients on machines , do they sometimes just jump up a level or two ? do something they didn't know they were capable of ? 
what do I do when I'm around someone I know ? 
he's just laying in bed . he's pretty upset . he won't talk . 
would you like to try going-- 
oh . Elijah Price came to visit me at the center today . 
... I think rust . 
as a color , not as rust . you know , a rust colored paint or wood ? 
soft and wet , by the artist formerly known as Prince . 
we're supposed to be honest . 
I'm not sure . 
I had a nightmare one night and I didn't wake you up so you could tell me it was okay . I think that was the first time . does that count ? 
why ? 
wrap it up . 
once again please ? 
how old is Jeb ? 
I'm listening . 
what about Jeb ? 
yes ? 
no sir he is not . I read about you in the paper . 
wow . 
proceed . 
is that the entire message ? 
where's the fire sweetheart ? don't know how they work things in Nevada , but we got speed limits in this state . 
whoa , what kind of accent you got there ? you one of them Russians ? 
what's that ? ... " concealed " is a definite no no in this town , Ivan . you know anything about Jamilla's grocery store ? 
get out of the car , spread them . you can jawbone all you want or you have the right to &lt; u &gt; shut the fuck up &lt; / u &gt; ! you commie motherfucker . either way you're goin' to the can . 
I axed you a question . 
honest , Toby . I just axed him for a quarter for the jukebox . 
I want to stay . 
who was that on the phone ? 
you spent a long time talking for a wrong number . but then you make friends so easily . don't you , Grace ? 
I know . I was here when your apprentice was helping you . remember ? 
they look nice . 
they look nice . 
what the hell you looking at , girl ? 
ya little bitch , you like it don't you ! you like it this way -- rough and hard . gotta go fuck around on me , like your Mama , but you always gotta come home to Daddy , don't you , cause you know Daddy's the best . 
oh no ! oh please forgive me , Papa ! 
what's the matter ? 
yeah , I heard a key slapping against my ass . 
Jake , don't go out there . call the sheriff . 
help me , Grace , help ... 
morning Grace . 
well it's about time . looks like you found yourself a helper too . 
anybody hurt ? 
you fuck this guy -- get him to do your dirty work and you think you can take the money and dump me ? 
I don't want the fuckin' money ! I'm not gonna give up everything I got for a lousy 50,000 dollars . it's &lt; u &gt; you &lt; / u &gt; . you &lt; u &gt; Grace &lt; / u &gt; or nothing . the whole thing ... I want you to be my wife .... What do you way Grace ? 
goddamnit Virgil , stop ! don't ! 
my lord , that little baby of yours Virgil , has gotten cuter'n a bunny's nose .
